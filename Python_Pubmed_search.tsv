"Gut microbiota are recognized to be important for anticancer therapy, yet the underlying mechanism is not clear. Here, through the analysis of clinical samples, we identify the mechanism by which the gut microbial metabolite butyrate inhibits hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and then explore new strategies for HCC treatment. In our study, we demonstrate that gut microbial metabolite butyrate improves anticancer therapy efficacy by regulating intracellular calcium homeostasis. Using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis, we found that butyrate metabolism is activated in HCC patients compared with healthy individuals. Butyrate levels are lower in the plasma of HCC patients by gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. Butyrate supplementation or depletion of short-chain Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (ACADS), a key enzyme for butyrate metabolism, significantly inhibits HCC proliferation and metastasis. Profiling analysis of genes upregulated by butyrate supplementation or ACADS knockdown reveals that calcium signaling pathway is activated, leading to dysregulation of intracellular calcium homeostasis and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Butyrate supplementation improves the therapy efficacy of a tyrosine kinase inhibitor sorafenib. Based on these findings, we developed butyrate and sorafenib co-encapsulated mPEG-PLGA-PLL (PEAL) nanoparticles (NPs) coated with anti-GPC3 antibody (BS@PEAL-GPC3) to prolong the retention time of drugs and enhance drug targeting, leading to high anticancer efficacy. BS@PEAL-GPC3 NPs significantly reduce HCC progression. In addition, BS@PEAL-GPC3 NPs display excellent HCC targeting with excellent safety. In conclusion, our findings provide new insight into the mechanism by which the gut microbial metabolites inhibit HCC progression, suggesting a translatable therapeutics approach to enhance the clinical targeted therapeutic efficacy."

"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a malignant tumor with high incidence in China, which is mainly related to chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and liver cirrhosis (LC) caused by hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. This study aimed to identify reproducible gut microbial biomarkers across Chinese population for LC and HCC diagnosis. In this study, a group of 21 CHB, 25 LC, 21 HCC and 15 healthy control (HC) were examined, and used as the training data. Four published faecal datasets from different regions of China were collected, totally including 121 CHB, 33 LC, 70 HCC and 96 HC. Beta diversity showed that the distribution of community structure in CHB, LC, HCC was significantly different from HC. Correspondingly, 14 and 10 reproducible differential genera across datasets were identified in LC and HCC, respectively, defined as LC-associated and HCC-associated genera. Two random forest (RF) models based on these reproducible genera distinguished LC or HCC from HC with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.824 and 0.902 in the training dataset, respectively, and achieved cross-region validations. Moreover, AUCs were greatly improved when clinical factors were added. A reconstructed random forest model on eight genera with significant changes between HCC and non-HCC can accurately distinguished HCC from LC. Conclusively, two RF models based on 14 reproducible LC-associated and 10 reproducible HCC-associated genera were constructed for LC and HCC diagnosis, which is of great significance to assist clinical early diagnosis."

"Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a chronic liver disease characterized by fibrosis that develops from fatty liver. Disruption of intestinal microbiota homeostasis, dysbiosis, is associated with fibrosis development in NASH. An antimicrobial peptide Î±-defensin secreted by Paneth cells in the small intestine is known to regulate composition of the intestinal microbiota. However, involvement of Î±-defensin in NASH remains unknown. Here, we show that in diet-induced NASH model mice, decrease of fecal Î±-defensin along with dysbiosis occurs before NASH onset. When Î±-defensin levels in the intestinal lumen are restored by intravenous administration of R-Spondin1 to induce Paneth cell regeneration or by oral administration of Î±-defensins, liver fibrosis is ameliorated with dissolving dysbiosis. Furthermore, R-Spondin1 and Î±-defensin improved liver pathologies together with different features in the intestinal microbiota. These results indicate that decreased Î±-defensin secretion induces liver fibrosis through dysbiosis, further suggesting Paneth cell Î±-defensin as a potential therapeutic target for NASH."

"Celastrol, a triterpene derived from <i>Thunder God Vine</i> (<i>Tripterygium wilfordii Hook f</i>; Celastraceae), a traditional Chinese herb, has promising anticancer activity. The present study aimed to elucidate an indirect mechanism of celastrol-mediated alleviation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) <i>via</i> gut microbiota-regulated bile acid metabolism and downstream signaling. Here, we constructed a rat model of orthotopic HCC and performed 16S rDNA sequencing and UPLC-MS analysis. The results showed that celastrol could regulate gut bacteria; suppress the abundance of <i>Bacteroides fragilis</i>; raise the levels of glycoursodeoxycholic acid (GUDCA), a bile acid; and alleviate HCC. We found that GUDCA suppressed cellular proliferation and induced the arrest of mTOR/S6K1 pathway-associated cell cycle G0/G1 phase in HepG2 cells. Further analyses using molecular simulations, Co-IP, and immunofluorescence assays revealed that GUDCA binds to farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and regulates the interaction of FXR with retinoid X receptor <i>a</i> (RXRÎ±). Transfection experiments using the FXR mutant confirmed that FXR is essential for GUCDA-mediated suppression of HCC cellular proliferation. Finally, animal experiments showed that the treatment with the combination of celastrol/GUDCA alleviated the adverse effects of celastrol alone treatment on body weight loss and improved survival in rats with HCC. In conclusion, the findings of this study suggest that celastrol exerts an alleviating effect on HCC, in part <i>via</i> regulation of the <i>B. fragilis</i>-GUDCA-FXR/RXRÎ±-mTOR axis."

"Patients with chronic liver disease (CLD) such as cirrhosis are at increased risk of intractable viral infections and are hyporesponsive to vaccination. Hallmarks of CLD and cirrhosis include microbial translocation and elevated levels of type I Interferon (IFN-I). We aimed to investigate the relevance of microbiota-induced IFN-I for the impaired adaptive immune responses in CLD. We combined BDL and CCl<sub>4</sub> models of liver injury with vaccination or LCMV-infection in transgenic mice lacking IFN-I in myeloid cells (LysM-Cre IFNAR<sup>flox/flox</sup>), IFNAR-induced IL-10 (MX1-Cre IL10<sup>flox/flox</sup>) or IL-10R in T-cells (CD4-DN IL-10R). Key pathways were blocked in vivo with specific antibodies (anti-IFNAR and anti-IL10R). We assessed T-cell responses and antibody titers after HBV and COVID vaccinations in CLD patients and healthy individuals in a proof-of-concept clinical study. We demonstrate that BDL- and CCL<sub>4</sub>-induced prolonged liver injury leads to impaired T-cell responses to vaccination in mice and cirrhosis patients as well as defective T-cell responses to viral infection in mice leading to persistent infection. Innate sensing of translocated gut microbiome induced IFN-I-signalling in hepatic myeloid cells that triggered excessive IL-10 production upon viral infection. IL-10R signalling in antigen-specific T-cells rendered them dysfunctional. Antibiotic treatment, IFNAR and IL-10RÎ± inhibition restored anti-viral immunity without detectable immune pathology in mice. Notably, IL-10RÎ± blockade restored the functional phenotype of T-cells from vaccinated cirrhosis patients. Loss of systemic T-cell immunity during prolonged liver injury is driven by IFN-/IL-10 expression induced by innate sensing of translocated microbiota. Chronic liver injury and cirrhosis are associated with enhanced susceptibility to viral infections and vaccine hypo-responsiveness. Using different pre-clinical animal models and patient samples, we identified that impaired T-cell immunity in BDL- and CCL<sub>4</sub>-induced prolonged liver injury is driven by sequential events involving microbial translocation, IFN signalling leading to myeloid cell-induced IL-10 expression, and IL-10-signaling in antigen-specific T-cells. Given the absence of immuno-pathology after interference with IL-10R, our study highlights a novel potential target to reconstitute T-cell immunity in CLD patients that can be explored in future clinical studies."

"Metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease related to metabolic syndrome. However, ecological shifts in the saliva microbiome in patients with MAFLD remain unknown. This study aimed to investigate the changes to the salivary microbial community in patients with MAFLD and explore the potential function of microbiota. Salivary microbiomes from ten MAFLD patients and ten healthy participants were analyzed by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and bioinformatics analysis. Body composition, plasma enzymes, hormones, and blood lipid profiles were assessed with physical examinations and laboratory tests. The salivary microbiome of MAFLD patients was characterized by increased Î±-diversity and distinct Î²-diversity clustering compared with control subjects. Linear discriminant analysis effect size analysis showed a total of 44 taxa significantly differed between the two groups. Genera Neisseria, Filifactor, and Capnocytophaga were identified as differentially enriched genera for comparison of the two groups. Co-occurrence networks suggested that the salivary microbiota from MAFLD patients exhibited more intricate and robust interrelationships. The diagnostic model based on the salivary microbiome achieved a good diagnostic power with an area under the curve of 0.82(95% CI: 0.61-1). Redundancy analysis and spearman correlation analysis revealed that clinical variables related to insulin resistance and obesity were strongly associated with the microbial community. Metagenomic predictions based on Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States revealed that pathways related to metabolism were more prevalent in the two groups. Patients with MAFLD manifested ecological shifts in the salivary microbiome, and the saliva microbiome-based diagnostic model provides a promising approach for auxiliary MAFLD diagnosis."

Hence, in this study, we aimed to investigate the gut microbiota profile associated with advanced hepatocarcinoma.

Changes in intestinal permeability and increased gut microbial translocation have been posited as important contributors to inflammation in both ALD and NAFLD. However, gut microbial translocation has not been compared between the two etiologies and can lead to better understanding of the differences in their pathogenesis to liver disease. We compared serum and liver markers in the following five models of liver disease to understand the differences in the role of gut microbial translocation on liver disease progression caused by ethanol versus Western diet: (1) 8-week chronic ethanol feeding model. (2) 2-week chronic-plus-binge (National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA)) ethanol feeding model.

Translocation of bacterial lipopolysaccharide to the peripheral circulation was seen in both ethanol-induced and diet-induced liver disease, but translocation of bacteria itself was restricted to only ethanol-induced liver disease. Moreover, the diet-induced steatohepatitis models developed more significant liver injury, inflammation, and fibrosis compared with ethanol-induced liver disease models, and this positively correlated with the level of lipopolysaccharide translocation. More significant liver injury, inflammation, and fibrosis are seen in diet-induced steatohepatitis, which positively correlates with translocation of bacterial components, but not intact bacteria."

"Aging and diet are risks for metabolic diseases. Bile acid receptor farnesoid X receptor (FXR) knockout (KO) mice develop metabolic liver diseases that progress into cancer as they age, which is accelerated by Western diet (WD) intake. The current study uncovers the molecular signatures for diet and age-linked metabolic liver disease development in an FXR-dependent manner. Wild-type (WT) and FXR KO male mice, either on a healthy control diet (CD) or a WD, were euthanized at the ages of 5, 10, or 15â€‰months. Hepatic transcriptomics, liver, serum, and urine metabolomics as well as microbiota were profiled. WD intake facilitated hepatic aging in WT mice. In an FXR-dependent manner, increased inflammation and reduced oxidative phosphorylation were the primary pathways affected by WD and aging. FXR has a role in modulating inflammation and B cell-mediated humoral immunity which was enhanced by aging. Moreover, FXR dictated neuron differentiation, muscle contraction, and cytoskeleton organization in addition to metabolism. There were 654 transcripts commonly altered by diets, ages, and FXR KO, and 76 of them were differentially expressed in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and healthy livers. Urine metabolites differentiated dietary effects in both genotypes, and serum metabolites clearly separated ages irrespective of diets. Aging and FXR KO commonly affected amino acid metabolism and TCA cycle. Moreover, FXR is essential for colonization of age-related gut microbes. Integrated analyses uncovered metabolites and bacteria linked with hepatic transcripts affected by WD intake, aging, and FXR KO as well as related to HCC patient survival. FXR is aÂ target to prevent diet or age-associated metabolic disease. The uncovered metabolites and microbes can be diagnostic markers for metabolic disease."

"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has a global prevalence of 25% of the population and is a leading cause of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. NAFLD ranges from simple steatosis (non-alcoholic fatty liver) to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Hepatic macrophages, specifically Kupffer cells (KCs) and monocyte-derived macrophages, act as key players in the progression of NAFLD. Caspases are a family of endoproteases that provide critical connections to cell regulatory networks that sense disease risk factors, control inflammation, and mediate inflammatory cell death (pyroptosis). Caspase-11 can cleave gasdermin D (GSDMD) to induce pyroptosis and specifically defends against bacterial pathogens that invade the cytosol. However, it's still unknown whether high fat diet (HFD)-facilitated gut microbiota-generated cytoplasmic lipopolysaccharides (LPS) activate caspase-11 and promote NAFLD. To examine this hypothesis, we performed liver pathological analysis, RNA-seq, FACS, Western blots, Seahorse mitochondrial stress analyses of macrophages and bone marrow transplantation on HFD-induced NAFLD in WT and Casp11-/- mice. Our results showed that 1) HFD increases body wight, liver wight, plasma cholesterol levels, liver fat deposition, and NAFLD activity score (NAS score) in wild-type (WT) mice; 2) HFD increases the expression of caspase-11, GSDMD, interleukin-1Î², and guanylate-binding proteins in WT mice; 3) Caspase-11 deficiency decreases fat liver deposition and NAS score; 4) Caspase-11 deficiency decreases bone marrow monocyte-derived macrophage (MDM) pyroptosis (inflammatory cell death) and inflammatory monocyte (IM) surface GSDMD expression; 5) Caspase-11 deficiency re-programs liver transcriptomes and reduces HFD-induced NAFLD; 6) Caspase-11 deficiency decreases extracellular acidification rates (glycolysis) and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in inflammatory fatty acid palmitic acid-stimulated macrophages, indicating that caspase-11 significantly contributes to maintain dual fuel bioenergetics-glycolysis and OXPHOS for promoting pyroptosis in macrophages. These results provide novel insights on the roles of the caspase-11-GSDMD pathway in promoting hepatic macrophage inflammation and pyroptosis and novel targets for future therapeutic interventions involving the transition of NAFLD to NASH, hyperlipidemia, type II diabetes, metabolic syndrome, metabolically healthy obesity, atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases, autoimmune diseases, liver transplantation, and hepatic cancers."

To eliminate the bias caused by confounding factors, propensity score matching (PSM) was used. On multivariate regression analysis, probiotic consumption was an independent protective factor for HCC occurrence. After PSM, the incidence of HCC was significantly lower in the probiotic users than that in the nonusers (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]: 0.70, 95% confidence interval: 0.59-0.83, <i>P</i> < 0.001). The aHRs for probiotics with 28-89, 90-180, and >180 cDDD were 0.58, 0.28, and 0.12, respectively, indicating a dose-response pattern. In 28-89, 90-180, and >180 cDDD, the 3-year cumulative incidence of HCC was 8.7%, 4.7%, and 3.0%, respectively. A multivariate stratified analysis confirmed that the administration of probiotics could help patients. Adjuvant probiotic therapy may reduce the risk of HCC in patients receiving antiviral medication for HBC. However, further clinical research is required to confirm these findings."

Based on the study of gut microbes and SERS spectra, complementary information could be provided for the mechanism analysis of related diseases. Liver fibrosis, a chronic liver disease that lack specific cure was thus comprehensive studied. Liver targeting gold nanoparticle dimers were prepared as the SERS tags, and abundant SERS peak signals were acquired. Meanwhile, the gut microbiomes were also comparative studied. The changes of carbohydrates and lipids in liver cells were observed at the early stages of liver fibrosis, and TLR4 (toll-like receptors 4) was activated to elicit immune responses. Then again, oxidative stress, endotoxin and serum inflammatory factors were the major observations at the late stages. The SERS signals and the microbiome analysis were well confirmed and complemented each other, which suggested that the detection strategy could be another valuable method for the ""gut-liver axis"" study."

"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease in most parts of the world. Although there is no first-line drug approved for the treatment of NAFLD, polyene phosphatidylcholine (PPC) is used by clinicians to treat NAFLD patients. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of PPC on a mice model of NAFLD, and to study the PPC's mechanism of action. The mice were fed a choline-deficient, L-amino acid-defined (CDAA) diet to induce NAFLD and were subsequently treated with PPC. The treatment effects were evaluated by the liver index, histopathological examination, and routine blood chemistry analyses. Lipidomics and metabolomics analyses of 54 samples were carried out using ultraperformance liquid chromatography (UPLC) coupled to a mass spectrometer to select for changes in metabolites associated with CDAA diet-induced NAFLD and the effects of PPC treatment. The intestinal flora of mice were extracted for gene sequencing to find differences before and after the induction of NAFLD and PPC treatment. PPC significantly improved the CDAA diet-induced NAFLD condition in mice. A total of 19 metabolites including 5 polar metabolites and 14 lipids showed marked changes. In addition, significant differences in the abundance of <i>Lactobacillus</i> were associated with NAFLD. We inferred that the protective therapeutic effect of PPC on the liver was related to the supplement of phosphatidylcholine, lysophosphatidylcholine, and sphingomyelin (PC, LPC, and SM, resectively) and acylcarnitine metabolism.

The genes modulating BM were available from the GeneCard database, and gene expression and clinical information were obtained from TCGA-LIHC, GEO, ICGC-JP, and CCLE databases. Candidate genes from these genes that regulate BM were then identified by univariate Cox analysis. According to candidate genes, the patients in TCGA were grouped into distinct subtypes. Moreover, BM- related gene signature (BMGs) was created via the LASSO Cox algorithm. The roles of BMGs in identifying high-risk patients of HCC, assessing the prognoses, and predicting systematic therapies were determined in various datasets. The statistical analyses were fulfilled with R 4.1.3, GraphPad Prism 8.0 and Perl 5.30.0.1 software. In the TCGA cohort, most butyrate-related genes were over-expressed in the B cluster, and patients in the B cluster showed worse prognoses. BMGs constructed by LASSO were composed of eight genes. BMGs exhibited a strong performance in evaluating the prognoses of HCC patients in various datasets, which may be superior to 33 published biomarkers. Furthermore, BMGs may contribute to the early surveillance of HCC, and BMGs could play active roles in assessing the effectiveness of immunotherapy, TACE, ablation therapy, and chemotherapeutic drugs for HCC. BMGs may be served as novel promising biomarkers for early identifying high-risk groups of HCC, as well as assessing prognoses, drug sensitivity, and the responses to immunotherapy, TACE, and ablation therapy in patients with HCC."

"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignant tumors of the digestive system worldwide, and there is a lack of effective treatment for late-stage HCC. Recent experimental studies have demonstrated that dysfunction of the intestinal flora has a significant impact on hepatocarcinogenesis. The pathophysiological link between the intestine, its microbiota, and the liver has been described as the ""gut-liver axis"". Dysbiosis of the intestinal flora and increased permeability of the intestinal wall are closely associated with liver pathology through the immune response. The ""gut-liver axis"" theory has been applied to the clinical study of the pathogenesis and treatment of HCC. The intestinal fungal community, as part of the gut microbiome, has a significant impact on human health and disease, while relatively little research has been done in HCC. In this study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the expression and potential biological functions of the fungal recognition receptors C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) (Dectin-1, Dectin-2, Dectin-3, and Mincle) in HCC. We found that CLRs were downregulated in HCC, and their expressions were correlated with the clinical prognosis of HCC patients. Further studies suggested that the expression of CLRs were significantly correlated with immune infiltration and immunotherapy efficacy in HCC. Based on previous studies and our findings, we hypothesize that intestinal fungal communities and CLRs-triggered antifungal immunity have a key role in the pathogenesis of HCC, and these findings may provide new perspectives and targets for HCC immunotherapy."

"The host dietary fibre is fermented into short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) by intestinal microbiota as bacterial metabolites like propionate, acetate and butyrate. Among these metabolites, the role of butyrate is well documented to provide energy to intestinal epithelial cells. Also, butyrate has anti-inflammatory and anti-tumour properties and decrease in its level by unbalanced diet can develops cancer. Lately, some research has suggested that sodium butyrate as an inhibitor of histone deacetylase (HDAC) may have anticancer potential for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common type of liver cancer. Since, HCC is asymptomatic it is usually diagnosed at its advanced stage. Sorafenib with antiproliferative and antiangiogenic effects is the first line of treatment in advanced HCC. However, prolonged drug treatment to HCC patients develops adaptive resistance towards the sorafenib. Sorafenib resistance can also be enhanced by differentially expressed microRNAs. However, the significance of butyrate in HCC sorafenib resistance and its association with sorafenib-targeted microRNAs is yet to be unfurled. Here, an attempt has been made to explore the role of bacterial metabolite butyrate on sorafenib resistant HCC as well as on sorafenib-targeted microRNAs (miR-7641 and miR-199) to curtail sorafenib resistance in HCC. Initially, in-silico analysis was performed using Human Metabolome Database (HMDB) so to identify specific butyrate producing faecal bacteria. Then, their specific 16s rRNA expression was compared between HCC patients and healthy individuals using qRT-PCR. Additionally, the cell viability (MTT) and apoptosis assays were performed in both parental and sorafenib resistant HepG2 cells to evaluate the role of sodium butyrate in sorafenib resistant HCC. Moreover, the association of sodium butyrate with sorafenib-targeted miR-7641 and miR-199 was also assessed using real time PCR, cell viability, cell apoptosis and transfection assays. In silico analysis demonstrated Roseburia cecical, Roseburia intestinalis, Eubacterium rectal, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii as specific butyrate producing faecal bacteria and their 16s rRNA expression was downregulated in HCC patients. In vitro study revealed the presence of sodium butyrate also decreased the cell viability as well as enhanced cell apoptosis of both parental and resistant HepG2 cells. Interestingly, sodium butyrate also decreased the expression of both sorafenib-targeted miR-7641 and miR-199. Further, combination of both sodium butyrate and antimiR-7641 or antimiR-199 also increased apoptosis and decreased viability of resistant cells. This is first study to unravel the association of butyrate producing bacteria with HCC patients and the significance of bacterial metabolite butyrate as anti-tumour in sorafenib resistant hepatocellular carcinoma. The study also demonstrated the plausible new aspects of bacterial metabolite butyrate association with sorafenib-targeted miRNAs (miR-7641 and miR-199).

We investigated the effects of Kuhuang on liver fibrosis and the underlying mechanisms of action. <b>Materials and methods:</b> To induce hepatic fibrosis, either 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydro-collidine (DDC) diet was administered, or bile duct ligation (BDL) surgery was performed on C57BL/6 mice. Kuhuang was orally administered to mice for 7Â days before and after bile duct ligation or 4Â weeks with a DDC diet. Hematoxylin and eosin, Sirius red staining, and immunohistochemical analyses were performed to evaluate hepatic pathology. Hepatic interferon-Î² (IFN-Î²) levels were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RNA sequencing was performed to examine the gene expression profiles of liver tissues. The mRNA expression of inflammatory, profibrotic, and bile acid (BA)-related genes was further validated by qRT-PCR. A targeted metabolomics assay revealed the alteration of the hepatic bile acid (BA) composition. The composition of the gut microbiota was determined <i>via</i> 16S rRNA sequencing. <b>Results:</b> Treatment with Kuhuang attenuated liver fibrosis and reduced the inflammatory response in bile duct ligation and DDC mouse models. In addition, the hepatic IFN signaling pathway was activated following Kuhuang treatment. Kuhuang treatment also significantly decreased hepatic levels of both primary and secondary BAs. In addition, Kuhuang treatment altered gut microbiota composition, with an increased abundance of interferon-inducing <i>Akkermansia</i> and decreased abundance of bile salt hydrolase-producing <i>Lactobacillus</i>, <i>Clostridium,</i> and <i>Bifidobacterium</i>.

Previous studies have demonstrated the therapeutic effects of BT2 on arthritis, liver cancer, and kidney injury. However, the effects of BT2 on ulcerative colitis (UC) are unknown. To investigate the anti-UC effects of BT2 and the underlying mechanism. Mouse UC models were created through the administration of 3.5% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) for 7 d. The mice in the treated groups were administered salazosulfapyridine (300 mg/kg) or BT2 (20 mg/kg) orally from day 1 to day 7. At the end of the study, all of the mice were sacrificed, and colon tissues were removed for hematoxylin and eosin staining, immunoblot analyses, and immunohistochemical assays. Cytokine levels were measured by flow cytometry. The contents of BCAAs including valine, leucine, and isoleucine, in mouse serum were detected by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, and the abundance of intestinal flora was analyzed by 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing. Our results revealed that BT2 significantly ameliorated the inflammatory symptoms and pathological damage induced by DSS in mice. BT2 also reduced the production of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-9, and IL-2 and increased the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 level. In addition, BT2 notably improved BCAA catabolism and suppressed mTORC1 activation and cyclooxygenase-2 expression in the colon tissues of UC mice. Furthermore, high-throughput sequencing revealed that BT2 restored the gut microbial abundance and diversity in mice with colitis. Compared with the DSS group, BT2 treatment increased the ratio of <i>Firmicutes</i> to <i>Bacteroidetes</i> and decreased the abundance of <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> and <i>Escherichia-Shigella</i>.

Several preclinical studies have shown a strong link between cyanotoxin exposure and the development of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, a precursor of hepatocellular carcinoma. Among the emerging threats from cyanotoxins, new evidence shows cylindrospermopsin release in freshwater lakes. A known hepatotoxin in higher concentrations, we examined the possible role of cylindrospermopsin in causing host gut dysbiosis and its association with liver pathology in a mouse model of toxico-pharmacokinetics and hepatic pathology. The results showed that oral exposure to cylindrospermopsin caused decreased diversity of gut bacteria phyla accompanied by an increased abundance of <i>Clostridioides difficile</i> and decreased abundance of probiotic flora such as <i>Roseburia</i>, <i>Akkermanssia,</i> and <i>Bacteroides&nbsp;thetaiotamicron</i>, a signature most often associated with intestinal and hepatic pathology and underlying gastrointestinal disease. The altered gut dysbiosis was also associated with increased Claudin2 protein in the intestinal lumen, a marker of gut leaching and endotoxemia. The study of liver pathology showed marked liver inflammation, the release of damage-associated molecular patterns, and activation of toll-like receptors, a hallmark of consistent and progressive liver damage. Hepatic pathology was also linked to increased Kupffer cell activation and stellate cell activation, markers of progressive liver damage often linked to the development of liver fibrosis and carcinoma.

"Gut dysbiosis has been reported in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infection, however its role in CHB progression and antiviral treatment remains to be clarified. Herein, the present study aimed to characterize gut microbiota (GM) in patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection-associated liver diseases (HBV-CLD) by combining microbiome with metabolome analyses and to evaluate their effects on peripheral immunity. Fecal samples from HBV-CLD patients (nÂ =Â 64) and healthy controls (nÂ =Â 17) were collected for 16s rRNA sequencing. Fecal metabolomics was measured with untargeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry in subgroups of 58 subjects. Lineage changes of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were determined upon exposure to bacterial extracts (BE) from HBV-CLD patients. Integrated analyses of microbiome with metabolome revealed a remarkable shift of gut microbiota and metabolites in HBV-CLD patients, and disease progression and antiviral treatment were found to be two main contributing factors for the shift. Concordant decreases in <i>Turicibacter</i> with 4-hydroxyretinoic acid were detected to be inversely correlated with serum AST levels through host-microbiota-metabolite interaction analysis in cirrhotic patients. Moreover, depletion of <i>E.hallii group</i> with elevated choline was restored in patients with 5-year antiviral treatment. PBMC exposure to BE from non-cirrhotic patients enhanced expansion of T helper 17 cells; however, BE from cirrhotics attenuated T helper 1 cell count. CHB progression and antiviral treatment are two main factors contributing to the compositional shift in microbiome and metabolome of HBV-CLD patients. Peripheral immunity might be an intermediate link in gut microbe-host interplay underlying CHB pathogenesis."

Moreover, the EtOH-treated group showed significantly altered gut microbial composition particularly that of <i>Alistipes, Bacteroides</i>, and <i>Muribaculum</i> and disrupted gut barrier function. However, Nonitri improved serum parameters, restored the microbial proportions, and regulated levels of zonula occludens1, occludin, and claudin1. Furthermore, Nonitri suppressed inflammation by inhibiting endotoxin-triggered toll-like receptor 4-signaling pathway and fat deposition by reducing lipogenesis through activating AMP-activated protein kinase in the liver. Furthermore, Pearson's correlation analysis showed that gut microbiota and ALD-related markers were correlated, and Nonitri regulated these bacteria. Taken together, our results indicate that the hepatoprotective effect of Nonitri reduces endotoxin levels by improving gut health, and inhibits fat deposition by regulating lipid metabolism."

"<b>Background:</b> Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are prevalent in China. According to traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) theory, damp-heat (DH) syndrome is common in chronic liver disease. However, the biological characteristics related to quantitative diagnosis remain to be determined. This study aimed to identify the consistent alterations in the gut microbiota associated with DH syndrome in patients with CHB or NAFLD. <b>Methods:</b> A total of 405 individuals were recruited, of which 146 were participants who met the consistent TCM diagnosis by three senior TCM physicians and were typical syndromes. All participants were required to provide fresh stool and serum samples. The gut microbiota was assessed by fecal 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and the serum metabolite profiles of participants were quantified by an ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) system. DH syndrome-related bacteria taxa were identified based on the 146 individuals with typical syndromes and validated in all 405 volunteers. <b>Results:</b> The results showed that CHB and NAFLD patients with typical TCM DH syndrome had consistently elevated serum total bile acid (TBA) levels. Significant alterations in microbial community were observed according to TCM syndromes identification. A total of 870 microbial operational taxonomic units and 21 serum metabolites showed the same variation trends in both the CHB and NAFLD DH syndrome groups. The functional analysis predicts consistent dysregulation of bile acid metabolism. Five genera (<i>Agathobacter, Dorea, Lachnospiraceae_NC2004_group, Subdoligranulum,</i> and <i>unclassified_c__Clostridia</i>) significantly decreased in abundance in patients with DH syndrome. We utilize these five genera combined with TBA to construct a random forest classifier model to predict TCM diagnosis. The diagnostic receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) areas for DH syndrome were 0.818 and 0.791 in internal tenfold cross-validation and the test set based on all 405 individuals, respectively. <b>Conclusion:</b> There are common signatures of gut microbiota associated with DH syndrome in patients with different chronic liver diseases.

We briefly review and comment on preliminary and recent evidences on prevalence, pathophysiology, and perspective treatment options for GI disturbances during and after COVID-19. Several reports from the literature show a significant portion of COVID-19 patients suffering from GI symptoms both at the early stages of the disease and after the end of it, sometimes for several months, namely ""long-COVID-19 "" patients, irrespective of vaccination. An unsolved issue regarding COVID-19 is the association between GI symptoms and the outcome of COVID-19 patients. Several studies and metanalyses suggest a worse evolution of COVID-19 in patients presenting with GI symptoms. However, these data have not been agreed. Indeed, only one uniform observation can be found in the literature: patients with chronic liver disease have a worse outcome from COVID-19 infection. Upper and lower GI symptoms have similarities with postinfectious functional dyspepsia (FD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). FD and IBS following infection are recognized as a pathophysiological factor, which is a gut microbial quali- and quantitative unbalance, namely dysbiosis. Furthermore, several preliminary reports and ongoing clinical trials have shown gut microbiota modulation by pre-, pro- and post-biotics to be effective in changing and preventing COVID-19 natural course.

"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the most common causes of chronic liver disease in the world. The NAFLD spectrum includes simple steatosis, steatohepatitis, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Genetic, nutritional factors, obesity, insulin resistance, gut microbiota are among the risk factors for NAFLD. The genetic variant Patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 3 (PNPLA3) plays an important role in the development of a number of liver diseases ranging from steatosis, chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and HCC. Due to the increase in the prevalence of NAFLD, new models are being developed with machine learning, deep learning, artificial neural network (ANN) algorithms in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) to determine low-cost, noninvasive diagnostic methods. Models developed with ANN from AI modules are important in order to examine biochemical and genomic information in detail in the diagnosis of NAFLD. The aim of this study is to develop a simple ANN model using biochemical and genotypic parameters in the diagnosis of NAFLD. A total of 300 patients followed up with the diagnosis of NAFLD and 100 controls were included in the study. The data set was divided into two as training and test set. Genotyping of PNPLA3 (CC, CG, GG) as genomic analysis was performed with real time PCR device. The algorithm used for the diagnosis of NAFLD was designed using age, body mass index (BMI), mean platelet volume (MPV), insulin resistance (IR), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), genotype PNPLA3 (CC, CG, GG) parameters. MLP Classifier algorithm from ANN was used in the development of the model. ANN algorithms are used in python programming language. Statistical analyzes were made in SPSS program. Percent accuracy, area under the ROC curve, confusion matrix, Positive (PPV) and Negative Predicted Value (NPV) values, precision, recall, and f1-score results were determined. The accuracy percentage was determined as 0.979 in the train set and 0.970 in the test set. The Log Loss value was set to 0.09. The developed neural network achieved an accuracy percentage of 97.0% during testing, with an area under the ROC curve value of 0.95.

Stool samples were collected from patients with cancer who received anti-PD-1 and chemotherapy combination treatment and were analyzed by fecal metagenomic sequencing. The microbiota diversity and composition were compared between the responder (R) and non-responder (NR) groups and the AE vs. the non-AE (NAE) groups. In addition, associated functional genes and metabolic pathways were identified. At baseline, the microbiota diversity of the groups was similar, but the genera <i>Parabacteroides</i>, <i>Clostridia bacterium UC5.1_2F7</i>, and <i>Bifidobacterium dentium</i> were enriched in the R group, whereas <i>Bacteroides dorei</i> and 11 species of <i>Nocardia</i> were enriched in the NR group.

"Bile acids (BAs) are physiological detergents that can not only promote the digestion and absorption of lipids, but also may be a potential carcinogen. The accumulation of BAs in the body can lead to cholestatic liver cirrhosis and even liver cancer. Recently, studies demonstrated that BAs are highly accumulated in metastatic lymph nodes, but not in normal healthy lymph nodes or primary tumors. Lymph node metastasis is second only to hematogenous metastasis in liver cancer metastasis, and the survival and prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with lymph node metastasis are significantly worse than those without lymph node metastasis. Meanwhile, component of BAs was found to significantly enhance the invasive potential of HCC cells. However, it is still poorly understood how deregulated BAs fuel the metastasis process of liver cancer. The tumor microenvironment is a complex cellular ecosystem that evolves with and supports tumor cells during their malignant transformation and metastasis progression. Aberrant BAs metabolism were found to modulate tumor immune microenvironment by preventing natural killer T (NKT) cells recruitment and increasing M2-like tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) polarization, thus facilitate tumor immune escape and HCC development. Based on these available evidence, we hypothesize that a combination of genetic and epigenetic factors in cancerous liver tissue inhibits the uptake and stimulates the synthesis of BAs by the liver, and excess BAs further promote liver carcinogenesis and HCC metastasis by inducing immunosuppressive microenvironment."

"Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is the most common chronic liver disease in the US, partly due to the increasing incidence of metabolic syndrome, obesity, and type 2 diabetes. The roles of bile acids and their receptors, such as the nuclear receptor farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and the G protein-coupled receptor TGR5, on the development of NASH are not fully clear. C57BL/6J male mice fed a Western diet (WD) develop characteristics of NASH, allowing determination of the effects of FXR and TGR5 agonists on this disease. Here we show that the FXR-TGR5 dual agonist INT-767 prevents progression of WD-induced hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis, as determined by histological and biochemical assays and novel label-free microscopy imaging techniques, including third harmonic generation, second harmonic generation, and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy. Furthermore, we show INT-767 decreases liver fatty acid synthesis and fatty acid and cholesterol uptake, as well as liver inflammation. INT-767 markedly changed bile acid composition in the liver and intestine, leading to notable decreases in the hydrophobicity index of bile acids, known to limit cholesterol and lipid absorption. In addition, INT-767 upregulated expression of liver p-AMPK, SIRT1, PGC-1Î±, and SIRT3, which are master regulators of mitochondrial function. Finally, we found INT-767 treatment reduced WD-induced dysbiosis of gut microbiota. Interestingly, the effects of INT-767 in attenuating NASH were absent in FXR-null mice, but still present in TGR5-null mice. Our findings support treatment and prevention protocols with the dual FXR-TGR5 agonist INT-767 arrest progression of WD-induced NASH in mice mediated by FXR-dependent, TGR5-independent mechanisms."

"Neonicotinoid insecticides (NNIs) are the most widely used class of pesticides globally. However, NNIs may cause adverse health effects, including chronic liver disease, and perturbation of the gut microbiota. Thiacloprid (THI) is one of the NNIs widely used in agriculture. Therefore, it is essential to elucidate effects of THI on the microbiota-gut-liver axis to assess the risk of chronic liver disease following exposure to NNIs. This study aimed at investigating whether THI exposure promoted liver injury by altering the gut microbiota and related metabolites. In this study, healthy male quails were exposed to 2 or 4Â mg/kg THI or 0.75 % (w/v) saline once daily for 6 weeks, respectively. Metabolomics, 16S rRNA sequencing, and transcriptomic methods were performed to analyze the toxic mechanisms of THI in Japanese quails. We found that THI evoked damage and disruption to intestinal barrier function, leading to increased harmful substances such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and phenylacetic acid entering the liver. Besides, our results showed significantly altered hepatic bile acid and cholesterol metabolism in THI-exposed quails, with abnormal liver lipid metabolism, showing severe liver injury, fibrosis, and steatosis compared with the control quails.

Fluorescence <i>in situ</i> hybridization revealed that microbial DNAs were distributed in the cytosol of liver hepatocytes and erythrocytes. Viable anaerobic or aerobic bacteria were recovered in HCC tissues by fresh tissue culture. We performed a comprehensive DNA sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA genes in 156 samples from 28 normal liver, 64 peritumoral, and 64 HCC tissues, and the DNA sequencing yielded 4.2 million high-quality reads. Both alpha and beta diversity in peritumor and HCC microbiota were increased compared to normal controls. The most predominant phyla in HCC were <i>Patescibacteria</i>, <i>Proteobacteria</i>, <i>Bacteroidota</i>, <i>Firmicutes</i>, and <i>Actinobacteriota</i>. phyla of <i>Proteobacteria</i>, <i>Firmicutes</i>, and <i>Actinobacteriota</i>, and classes of <i>Bacilli</i> and <i>Actinobacteria</i>, were consistently enriched in peritumor and HCC tissues, while <i>Gammaproteobacteria</i> was especially abundant in HCC tissues compared to normal controls. <i>Streptococcaceae</i> and <i>Lactococcus</i> were the marker taxa of HCC cirrhosis. The Staphylococcus branch and <i>Caulobacter</i> branch were selectively enriched in HBV-negative HCCs. The abundance of <i>Proteobacteria</i>, <i>Gammaproteobacteria</i>, <i>Firmicutes</i>, <i>Actinobacteriota</i>, and <i>Saccharimonadia</i> were associated with the clinicopathological features of HCC patients. The inferred functions of different taxa were changed between the microbiota of normal liver and peritumor/HCC.

Intratumoral bacteria are supposed to be closer to the tumor cells, forming a microenvironment that may be relevant to the pathological process of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the presence of viable intratumoral bacteria remains unclear. It is worth exploring whether the metataxonomic characteristics of intratumoral bacteria can be used as a potential marker for HCC prediction.

"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common and fatal cancers worldwide, yet therapeutic options for CRC often exhibit strong side effects which cause patients' well-being to deteriorate. Theabrownin (TB), an antioxidant from Pu-erh tea, has previously been reported to have antitumor effects on non-small-cell lung cancer, osteosarcoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, gliomas, and melanoma. However, the potential antitumor effect of TB on CRC has not previously been investigated in vivo. The present study therefore aimed to investigate the antitumor effect of TB on CRC and the underlying mechanisms. Azoxymethane (AOM)/dextran sodium sulphate (DSS) was used to establish CRC tumorigenesis in a wild type mice model. TB was found to significantly reduce the total tumor count and improve crypt length and fibrosis of the colon when compared to the AOM/DSS group. Immunohistochemistry staining shows that the expression of the proliferation marker, Ki67 was reduced, while cleaved caspase 3 was increased in the TB group. Furthermore, TB significantly reduced phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B (Akt), and the downstream mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)and cyclin D1 protein expression, which might contribute to cell proliferation suppression and apoptosis enhancement. The 16s rRNA sequencing revealed that TB significantly modulated the gut microbiota composition in AOM/DSS mice. TB increased the abundance of short chain fatty acid as well as SCFA-producing <i>Prevotellaceae</i> and <i>Alloprevotella</i>, and it decreased CRC-related <i>Bacteroidceae</i> and <i>Bacteroides</i>.

"Studies of the gut-liver axis have enhanced our understanding of the pathophysiology of various liver diseases and the mechanisms underlying the regulation of the effectiveness of therapies. Radiotherapy (RT) is an important therapeutic option for patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the role of the microbiome in regulating the response to RT remains unclear. The present study characterizes the gut microbiome of patients responsive or non-responsive to RT and investigates the molecular mechanisms underlying the differences in patient response. We collected fecal samples for 16S rRNA sequencing from a prospective longitudinal trial of 24 HCC patients receiving RT. We used fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), flow cytometry, and transcriptome sequencing to explore the effects of dysbiosis on RT. We also examined the role of stimulator of interferon genes (STING) in RT-associated antitumor immune responses mediated by gut microbiota in STING- (Tmem173<sup>-/-</sup>) and cGAS-knockout (Mb21d1<sup>-/-</sup>) mouse models. We propose that primary resistance to RT could be attributed to the disruption of the gut microbiome. Mechanistically, gut microbiome dysbiosis impairs antitumor immune responses by suppressing antigen presentation and inhibiting effector T cell functions through the cGAS-STING-IFN-I pathway. Cyclic-di-AMP - an emerging second messenger of bacteria - may act as a STING agonist and is thus a potential target for the prediction and modulation of responses to RT in HCC patients.

This study was aimed at investigating the therapeutic mechanism of SX on high-fat diet-induced NAFLD rats via the gut-liver axis. Hepatic steatosis and integrity of intestinal mucosa in NAFLD rats were assessed by histopathological staining. The level of lipid and inflammation were estimated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Western Blotting was used to detect apolipoprotein (apo) B48 expression. 16S rRNA analysis was used to measure the changes of gut microbial composition after SX treatment. The expressions of zona occludens 1 protein (ZO-1), occludin, and secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) in the colon were detected by immunostaining to investigate the intestinal barrier function. Our study found that SX reduced hepatic steatosis, the levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total cholesterol, and triglyceride and apoB48 expression but increased peroxisome proliferator activated receptor <i>Î±</i> (PPAR<i>Î±</i>) level. Moreover, SX altered the diversity of gut microbiota, upregulating the relative abundance of <i>f_Prevotellaceae</i>, while downregulating <i>f_Bacteroidales_ S24-7</i>, <i>f_Lachnospiraceae</i>, <i>f_Ruminococcaceae</i>, <i>f_Erysipelotrichaceae</i>, and <i>f_Desulfovibrionaceae</i>. By increasing the expression of ZO-1 and occludin and decreasing the level of proinflammatory factors, including sIgA, lipopolysaccharide, tumor necrosis factor-<i>Î±</i>, interleukin-1<i>Î²</i>, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, and transforming growth factor-<i>Î²</i>1, SX improved intestinal mucosal integrity and barrier function. Our study illustrated that the gut-liver axis was a potential way for SX to ameliorate NAFLD, that is, by regulating the expression of PPAR<i>Î±</i>, apoB48, and modulating gut microbiota to protect the intestinal barrier function, and thus alleviate lipid deposition and inflammatory response in the liver."

"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, and therapeutic options for advanced HCC are limited. Here, we observe that intestinal dysbiosis affects antitumor immune surveillance and drives liver disease progression towards cancer. Dysbiotic microbiota, as seen in Nlrp6<sup>-/-</sup> mice, induces a Toll-like receptor 4 dependent expansion of hepatic monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (mMDSC) and suppression of T-cell abundance. This phenotype is transmissible via fecal microbiota transfer and reversible upon antibiotic treatment, pointing to the high plasticity of the tumor microenvironment. While loss of Akkermansia muciniphila correlates with mMDSC abundance, its reintroduction restores intestinal barrier function and strongly reduces liver inflammation and fibrosis. Cirrhosis patients display increased bacterial abundance in hepatic tissue, which induces pronounced transcriptional changes, including activation of fibro-inflammatory pathways as well as circuits mediating cancer immunosuppression. This study demonstrates that gut microbiota closely shapes the hepatic inflammatory microenvironment opening approaches for cancer prevention and therapy."

"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease, whose etiology is poorly understood.

In this study, NAFLD mouse models were established by feeding a high-fat diet (HFD). Baicalein, a natural flavonoid with multiple biological activities, was administered by gavage, and its protective effect on NAFLD was analyzed by histopathological and blood factor analysis. Gut microbiota analysis demonstrated that baicalein could remodel the overall structure of the gut microbiota from NAFLD model mice, especially <i>Anaerotruncus</i>, <i>Lachnoclostridium,</i> and <i>Mucispirillum.</i> Transcriptomic analysis showed baicalein restored the expressions of numerous genes that were upregulated in hepatocytes of NAFLD mice, such as <i>Apoa4</i>, <i>Pla2g12a</i>, <i>Elovl7</i>, <i>Slc27a4</i>, <i>Hilpda</i>, <i>Fabp4</i>, <i>Vldlr</i>, <i>Gpld1</i>, and <i>Apom</i>.

"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease with no currently approved treatment.

Gut microbiota has been proposed to play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of NAFLD and targeted for disease control. Cyclodextrins, the cyclic oligosaccharides, were documented to have various health benefits with potential prebiotic properties. This study aimed to develop a silybin-2-hydroxypropyl-Î²-cyclodextrin inclusion (SHÎ²CD) to improve the therapeutic efficacy of SLN and elucidate the mechanisms of improvement. The results showed that SLN formed a 1:1 stoichiometric inclusion complex with HP-Î²-CD. The solubility of SLN was increased by generating SHÎ²CD, resulting in improved drug permeability and bioavailability. In high-fat diet (HFD)-fed hamsters, SHÎ²CD modulated gut health by restoring the gut microbiota and intestinal integrity. SHÎ²CD showed superior anti-lipid accumulation, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory effects compared with SLN alone. Transcriptome analysis in the liver tissue implied that the improved inflammation and/or energy homeostasis was the potential mechanism. Therefore, SHÎ²CD may be a promising alternative for the treatment of NAFLD, attributing to the dual functions of HÎ²CD on drug absorption and gut microbial homeostasis."

"Long-term senescent cells exhibit a secretome termed the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Although the mechanisms of SASP factor induction have been intensively studied, the release mechanism and how SASP factors influence tumorigenesis in the biological context remain unclear. In this study, using a mouse model of obesity-induced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), we identified the release mechanism of SASP factors, which include interleukin-1Î² (IL-1Î²)- and IL-1Î²-dependent IL-33, from senescent hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) via gasdermin D (GSDMD) amino-terminal-mediated pore. We found that IL-33 was highly induced in senescent HSCs in an IL-1Î²-dependent manner in the tumor microenvironment. The release of both IL-33 and IL-1Î² was triggered by lipoteichoic acid (LTA), a cell wall component of gut microbiota that was transferred and accumulated in the liver tissue of high-fat diet-fed mice, and the release of these factors was mediated through cell membrane pores formed by the GSDMD amino terminus, which was cleaved by LTA-induced caspase-11. We demonstrated that IL-33 release from HSCs promoted HCC development via the activation of ST2-positive T<sub>reg</sub> cells in the liver tumor microenvironment. The accumulation of GSDMD amino terminus was also detected in HSCs from human NASH-associated HCC patients, suggesting that similar mechanism could be involved in a certain type of human HCC. These results uncover a release mechanism for SASP factors from sensitized senescent HSCs in the tumor microenvironment, thereby facilitating obesity-associated HCC progression. Furthermore, our findings highlight the therapeutic potential of inhibitors of GSDMD-mediated pore formation for HCC treatment."

The gut microbiome can modulate tumor response to immunotherapy, but its effect on HCC remains unclear. From May 2018 to February 2020, patients receiving ICI treatment for uHCC were prospectively enrolled; their fecal samples were collected before treatment. The fecal microbiota and metabolites were analyzed from 20 patients with radiology-proven objective responses (OR) and 21 randomly selected patients with progressive disease (PD). After March 2020, 33 consecutive Child-Pugh-A patients were recruited as a validation cohort. Additionally, feces from 17 healthy volunteers were collected for comparison of background microbes. A significant dissimilarity was observed in fecal bacteria between patients with OR and patients with PD before immunotherapy. <i>Prevotella 9</i> was enriched in patients with PD, whereas <i>Lachnoclostridium, Lachnospiraceae,</i> and <i>Veillonella</i> were predominant in patients with OR.

"Hepatic lipid accumulation, inflammation and gut microbiota dysbiosis are hallmarks of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which is the leading cause of chronic liver disease with no therapeutic consensus. The aim of the present study was to elucidate the mechanism of the effects of <i>Astragalus</i> mongholicus polysaccharides (mAPS) on lipid metabolism, inflammation and gut microbiota in a rat model of NAFLD induced by a high-fat diet (HFD). Our results showed that mAPS and Berberine supplementation reduced HFD-induced increases in body weight, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and these changes were accompanied by improved histological changes in the liver. Moreover, administration of mAPS and Berberine resulted in lower levels of serum triglycerides, total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) but higher levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) in HFD-fed rats. mAPS and Berberine treatment markedly reduced HFD-induced hepatic lipid accumulation, which was associated with increased expression of phosphorylated- adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-Î± (PPAR-Î±) but decreased expression of sterol-regulatory element binding proteins (SREBP-1). Pretreatment with mAPS or Berberine reduced HFD-induced expression of proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNF-Î±). In addition, mAPS downregulated the expression of colonic and hepatic Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) as well as phosphorylated- nuclear factor-ÎºB (NF-ÎºB) and nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich repeat-containing receptor, pyrin domain-containing-3 (NLRP3) but upregulated the expression of zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and occludin in HFD-fed rats. Notably, mAPS treatment reshaped the intestinal microbiome by lowering the <i>Firmicutes</i> to <i>Bacteroidetes</i> (F/B) ratio and increasing the abundance of <i>Proteobacteria</i> and <i>Epsilonbacteria</i>. mAPS supplementation had little effect on the profile of fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), but it significantly decreased the expression of colonic and hepatic G-protein coupled receptor (GPR) 41 and 43.

Methods: Male mice were randomly assigned to groups-the model group, cyclophosphamide (25Â mg/kg/d), and EPA groups, in which the mice were categorized based on the different concentrations of each compound (100, 200, and 300Â mg/kg/day). Relevant biochemical indicators were detected using ELISA, H&E staining, and TUNEL assay. Four tumor apoptosis-related proteins and genes, Cleaved Caspases, BAX, Bcl-2, and VEGF, were detected by immunohistochemical staining, western blotting, and RT-PCR. The total genomic DNA was obtained from the contents of the small intestine and colon and was sequenced. The V3â€‰+â€‰V4 regions of bacterial 16Â s rDNA (from 341 to 806) were amplified. Results: The tests revealed that EPA exhibited antitumor activity in vivo by promoting apoptosis and inhibiting angiogenesis.

To assess the short-term efficacy and safety of the probiotic <i>Escherichia coli Nissle</i> (EcN) 1917 strain compared to lactulose and rifaximin in patients with minimal/mild HE. From January 2017 to March 2020, a total of 45 patients with HE were enrolled in this prospective, single-centre, open-label, randomized study. Participants were randomly assigned at a ratio of 1:1:1 to one of the treatment groups: The EcN group (<i>n</i> = 15), lactulose group (<i>n</i> = 15) or rifaximin group (<i>n</i> = 15) for a 1 mo intervention period. The main primary outcomes of the study were changes in serum ammonia and Stroop test score. The secondary outcomes were markers of a chronic systemic inflammatory response (Ð†L-6, Ð†L-8, and IFN-Î³) and bacteriology of the stool flora evaluated by specialized nonculture techniques after a 1 mo intervention period. Patients who were given rifaximin or EcN showed a more significant reduction in serum ammonia and normalization of <i>Bifidobacteria</i> and <i>Lactobacilli</i> abundance compared to the lactulose group. However, the most pronounced restoration of the symbiotic microflora was associated with EcN administration and characterized by the absence of <i>E. coli</i> with altered properties and pathogenic enterobacteria in patient faeces. In the primary outcome analysis, improvements in the Stroop test parameters in all intervention groups were observed. Moreover, EcN-treated patients performed 15% faster on the Stroop test than the lactulose group patients (<i>P</i> = 0.017). Both EcN and rifaximin produced similar significant reductions in the proinflammatory cytokines INF-Î³, IL-6 and IL-8. EcN was more efficient than lactulose in reducing proinflammatory cytokine levels. The use of the probiotic EcN strain was safe and quite efficient for HE treatment. The probiotic reduced the ammonia content and the level of serum proinflammatory cytokines, normalized the gut microbiota composition and improved the cognitive function of patients with HE. The application of the EcN strain was more effective than lactulose treatment."	"[StringElement('Clinical Trial', attributes={'UI': 'D016430'})]"	35582294	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	hepatic encepahlopathy

"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a severe disease with high mortality and global incidence. However, the interaction between the gut microbiome and combined immunotherapy for HCC is yet unclear. In this prospective clinical study, patients with unresectable HCC who had not received systemic treatment previously were recruited. Fecal and serum samples were collected at the baseline point and before each subsequent administration as specified. Between 20 October 2019 and 2 February 2021, 61 patients were screened for eligibility, of whom 35 patients were finally included in this study. Alpha diversity of fecal samples from patients who responded to immunotherapy was higher than that of nonresponders at baseline. However, the prominent alpha-diversity between responders and nonresponders became similar as early as week 6 after treatment. The beta diversity of intergroup did not show significant difference at the ninth week after treatment. Alpha-d-Glucose was the only serum metabolite that differed between the responders and nonresponders after 3Â months. Responder-enriched Ruminococcus showed a positive correlation with serum galactaric acid, while Klebsiella was positively associated with 3-methylindole and lenticin (all Pâ€‰<â€‰.01).

From September 2020 to May 2021, patients with HBV-HCC were able to undergo liver resection and were recruited consecutively and divided into the younger age group (age <45 years) (Y.AG) (n=20), middle age group (age from 45 to 65 years) (M.AG) (n=13) 45-65 years, and older age group (age >65 years) (O.AG) (n=20). The relationships between gut microbiota and different ages were explored using 16S rRNA gene sequencing data. PICRUST2 was used to examine the metagenomic data in PHLF patients. Fisher's exact and Mann-Whitney <i>U</i>-test were used for the data analysis. Pairwise comparison between the three groups showed that the Î±-diversity of Y.AG was significantly higher than that of O.AG (ACE Index, P=0.017; chao1 Index, P=0.031; observed_species Index, P=0.011; and goods_coverage Index, P=0.041).

The results showed that Pt and OHPt significantly ameliorated FFA-induced steatosis in HepG2 cells and enhanced lipolysis through the upregulation of SIRT1/AMPK and insulin signaling pathways. In the <i>in vivo</i> study, Pt and OHPt treatment resulted in reduced hepatic lipid droplets accumulation. The data showed that Pt and OHPt upregulated the SIRT1/AMPK pathway and subsequently downregulated the protein expression of SREBP-1 to activate fatty acid (FA) Î²-oxidation to inhibit FA synthesis.

The aim of this study was to investigate the characteristics of gut microbiota in patients with HCC-MVI and establish a microbial prediction model of HCC-MVI based on a microbiome study. Fecal samples were collected from 59 patients with HCC (24 of the total with MVI disease and 16 healthy controls) and were further analyzed by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing followed by a comprehensive bioinformatic analysis. The diagnostic performance of microbiome characteristics in predicting MVI was assessed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The correlation between gut microbiota and tumor microenvironment (TME) in the HCC-MVI group was further analyzed by using immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence assay. A significant differentiation trend of microbiota composition and structure was observed between the HCC-MVI group and those without vascular invasion (HCC-NVI).

"Type 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) are essential for host defense against infection and tissue homeostasis. However, their role in the development of HCC has not been adequately confirmed. In this study, we investigated the immunomodulatory role of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) derived from intestinal microbiota in ILC3 regulation. We report that Lactobacillus reuteri was markedly reduced in the gut microbiota of mice with HCC, accompanied by decreased SCFA levels, especially acetate. Additionally, transplantation of fecal bacteria from wild-type mice or L. reuteri could promote an anticancer effect, elevate acetate levels, and reduce IL-17A secretion in mice with HCC. Mechanistically, acetate reduced the production of IL-17A in hepatic ILC3s by inhibiting histone deacetylase activity, increasing the acetylation of SRY (sex-determining region Y)-box transcription factor 13 (Sox13) at site K30, and decreasing expression of Sox13. Moreover, the combination of acetate with programmed death 1/programmed death ligand 1 blockade significantly enhanced antitumor immunity. Consistently, tumor-infiltrating ILC3s correlated with negative prognosis in patients with HCC, which could be functionally mediated by acetate. These findings suggested that modifying bacteria, changing SCFAs, reducing IL-17A-producing ILC3 infiltration, and combining with immune checkpoint inhibitors will contribute to the clinical treatment of HCC."

This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic role of the gut microbiota and changes produced by immunotherapy on the intestinal environment in patients with cirrhosis and HCC. Eleven patients treated with Tremelimumab and/or Durvalumab were included in the analysis. All study participants underwent gut microbiota profiling, quantification of fecal calprotectin, serum levels of zonulin-1, lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP), and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) at baseline and at each treatment cycle until the third cycle, then every three cycles until treatment discontinuation or last visit.

During treatment, fecal calprotectin showed a temporal evolution opposite to the Akkermansia to Enterobacteriaceae ratio and gut microbiota alpha diversity, but similar to zonulin-1 and LBP. Bifidobacterium had a stable behavior in patients with a long follow-up, while Akkermansia was more variable. Akkermansia and Bifidobacterium showed similar temporal patterns and causative relationships with Prevotella, Veillonella, Ruminococcus, Roseburia, Lachnospira, Faecalibacterium, and Clostridium.

"Human breath offers several benefits for diagnostic applications, including simple, noninvasive collection. Breath is a rich source of clinically-relevant biological information; this includes a volatile fraction, where greater than 1,000 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) have been described so far, and breath aerosols that carry nucleic acids, proteins, signaling molecules, and pathogens. Many of these factors, especially VOCs, are delivered to the lung by the systemic circulation, and diffusion of candidate biomarkers from blood into breath allows systematic profiling of organismal health. Biomarkers on breath offer the capability to advance early detection and precision medicine in areas of global clinical need. Breath tests are noninvasive and can be performed at home or in a primary care setting, which makes them well-suited for the kind of public screening program that could dramatically improve the early detection of conditions such as lung cancer. Since measurements of VOCs on breath largely report on metabolic changes, this too aids in the early detection of a broader range of illnesses and can be used to detect metabolic shifts that could be targeted through precision medicine. Furthermore, the ability to perform frequent sampling has envisioned applications in monitoring treatment responses. Breath has been investigated in respiratory, liver, gut, and neurological diseases and in contexts as diverse as infectious diseases and cancer. Preclinical research studies using breath have been ongoing for some time, yet only a few breath-based diagnostics tests are currently available and in widespread clinical use. Most recently, tests assessing the gut microbiome using hydrogen and methane on breath, in addition to tests using urea to detect <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> infections have been released, yet there are many more applications of breath tests still to be realized. Here, we discuss the strengths of breath as a clinical sampling matrix and the technical challenges to be addressed in developing it for clinical use. Historically, a lack of standardized methodologies has delayed the discovery and validation of biomarker candidates, resulting in a proliferation of early-stage pilot studies. We will explore how advancements in breath collection and analysis are in the process of driving renewed progress in the field, particularly in the context of gastrointestinal and chronic liver disease.

"Intestinal epithelial barrier disruption and bacterial translocation exacerbates the progression of alcoholic liver disease. Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG), a probiotic, has been shown benefits in chronic liver disease and in regulating gut dysbiosis. Previous studies showed the protective roles of LGG in ethanol-disrupted gut barrier functions and liver injury. Inosine, a metabolite produced by intestinal bacteria, has the anti-inflammatory and immunregulatory functions. In this study, the synergistic effect of LGG and inosine was investigated in a mouse model of alcohol-induced liver disease (ALD). Male C57BL/6 mice were fed with a Lieber-DeCarli diet containing 5% alcohol for four weeks to establish a model of alcohol-induced liver injury. LGG or a combination of LGG and inosine were administrated orally to explore a new therapeutic method for alcohol-induced liver disease and to investigate the underlying mechanisms. Liver damage was evaluated by transaminases and pathological changes. Tight junction proteins, composition of the gut microbiome, cytokines, lipopolysaccharides (LPS), glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA), F4/80+ macrophages, as well as p38, Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), were determined by qRT-PCR, RNAseq, ELISA, IHC and western blot. Regulatory T (Treg) cells were characterized by positive staining of CD4, CD25 and Foxp3 using flow cytometry. IFN-Î³-producing CD4<sup>+</sup> T (Th1) cells were examined by intracellular cytokine staining. Alcohol consumption induced elevated liver enzymes, steatosis and inflammation, while LGG combined with inosine treatment was more significant to ameliorate these symptoms compared with LGG alone. When LGG combined with inosine were administered to ALD mice, intestinal microecology significantly improved reflected by intestinal villi and tight junction proteins recovery and the restoration of intestinal flora. Combined therapy inhibited phosphorylation of p38 and JNK to alleviate hepatic inflammation. Moreover, flow cytometry analysis showed that long-term excessive alcohol consumption reduced Tregs population while increased Th1 population, which was restored by a combination of LGG and inosine treatment.

"Immunotherapy has revolutionized the clinical outcomes of intractable cancer patients. Little is known about the intestinal nonpathogenic bacterial composition of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients treated by immunotherapy. To determine whether there is a correlation between gut bacterial composition and prognosis in HCC patients. From September 2019 to March 2020, we prospectively collected fecal samples and examined the gut microbiome of 8 advanced HCC patients treated with nivolumab as a second- or third-line systemic treatment. Fecal samples were collected before the start of immunotherapy. Fecal samples of patients with progression during treatment were collected at the time of progression, and fecal samples of patients who showed good response to nivolumab were collected after 5-7 mo as follow-up. Metagenomic data from 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing were analyzed using CLC Genomics Workbench. Microbiome data were analyzed according to therapeutic response. All 8 patients were male, of which 6 had underlying chronic hepatitis B. A higher Shannon index was found in the responders than in the non-responders after nivolumab therapy (<i>P</i> = 0.036). The unweighted beta diversity analysis also showed that the overall bacterial community structure and phylogenetic diversity were clearly distinguished according to therapeutic response. There was no significant difference in the diversity or composition of the patient gut microbiome according to the immunotherapy used. Several taxa specific to therapeutic response were designated as follows: <i>Dialister pneumosintes, Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus reteri, Streptococcus mutans, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus gordonii, Veillonella atypica, Granulicatella</i> sp., and <i>Trchuris trichiura</i> for the non-responders; <i>Citrobacter freundii, Azospirillum</i> sp. and <i>Enterococcus durans</i> for the responders. Of note, a skewed <i>Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes</i> ratio and a low <i>Prevotella/Bacteroides</i> ratio can serve as predictive markers of non-response, whereas the presence of <i>Akkermansia</i> species predicts a good response. The current presumptive study suggests a potential role for the gut microbiome as a prognostic marker for the response to nivolumab in treatment of HCC patients."

"The gut microbiome is associated with the response to immunotherapy for different cancers. However, the impact of the gut microbiome on hepatobiliary cancers receiving immunotherapy remains unknown. This study aims to investigate the relationship between the gut microbiome and the clinical response to anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) immunotherapy in patients with advanced hepatobiliary cancers. Patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma or advanced biliary tract cancers who have progressed from first-line chemotherapy (gemcitabine plus cisplatin) were enrolled. Fresh stool samples were collected before and during anti-PD-1 treatment and analyzed with metagenomic sequencing. Significantly differentially enriched taxa and prognosis associated taxa were identified. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database and MetaCyc database were further applied to annotate the differentially enriched taxa to explore the potential mechanism of the gut microbiome influencing cancer immunotherapy. In total, 65 patients with advanced hepatobiliary cancers receiving anti-PD-1 treatment were included in this study. Seventy-four taxa were significantly enriched in the clinical benefit response (CBR) group and 40 taxa were significantly enriched in the non-clinical benefit (NCB) group. Among these taxa, patients with higher abundance of Lachnospiraceae bacterium-GAM79 and Alistipes sp Marseille-P5997, which were significantly enriched in the CBR group, achieved longer progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) than patients with lower abundance. Higher abundance of Ruminococcus calidus and Erysipelotichaceae bacterium-GAM147 enriched in the CBR group was also observed in patients with better PFS. In contrast, worse PFS and OS were found in patients with higher abundance of Veillonellaceae, which was significantly enriched in the NCB group. Functional annotation indicated that the taxa enriched in the CBR group were associated with energy metabolism while the taxa enriched in the NCB group were associated with amino acid metabolism, which may modulate the clinical response to immunotherapy in hepatobiliary cancers. In addition, immunotherapy-related adverse events were affected by the gut microbiome diversity and relative abundance. We demonstrate that the gut microbiome is associated with the clinical response to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in patients with hepatobiliary cancers. Taxonomic signatures enriched in responders are effective biomarkers to predict the clinical response and survival benefit of immunotherapy, which might provide a new therapeutic target to modulate the response to cancer immunotherapy."

It has been prevalent and on the rise for many years and is associated with other metabolic disorders such as obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). NAFLD can be best described as a metabolic dysfunction that stems from insulin resistance-induced hepatic lipogenesis. This lipogenesis increases oxidative stress and hepatic inflammation and is often potentiated by genetic and gut microbiome dysfunction. As NAFLD progresses from simple steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the odds of complications including cardiovascular disease (CVD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and overall mortality increase. The aim of this review is to describe the metabolic causes and consequences of NAFLD while examining the risks that each stage of NAFLD poses. In this review, the etiology of ""lean"" NAFLD, the impact of obesity, T2DM, genetics, and microbiome dysbiosis on NAFLD progression are all explored.

Our cross-sectional analysis assessed the association of the GM with hepatic adiposity among African American, Japanese American, White, Latino, and Native Hawaiian participants in the Multiethnic Cohort. We used MRI to measure liver fat and determine nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) status (n = 511 cases) in 1,544 participants, aged 60-77 years, with 12-53% overall adiposity (BMI of 17.8-46.2 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). The GM was measured by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and, on a subset, by metagenomic sequencing. Alpha diversity was lower overall with NAFLD and in certain ethnicities (African Americans, Whites, and Latinos). In models regressing genus on NAFLD status, 62 of 149 genera (40%) exhibited a significant interaction between NAFLD and ethnicity stratified analysis found 69 genera significantly associated with NAFLD in at least one ethnic group. No single genus was significantly associated with NAFLD across all ethnicities. In contrast, the same bacterial metabolic pathways were over-represented in participants with NAFLD regardless of ethnicity. Imputed secondary bile acid and carbohydrate pathways were associated with NAFLD, the latter of which was corroborated by metagenomics, although different genera in different ethnicities were associated with these pathways. Overall, we found that NAFLD was associated with altered bacterial composition and metabolism, and that bacterial endotoxin, assessed by plasma lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP), may mediate liver fat-associated systemic inflammation in a manner that seems to vary by ethnicity."

"Recent evidence suggests that complex diseases can result from early life exposure to environmental toxicants. Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and remain a continuing risk to human health despite being banned from production. Developmental BPA exposure mediated-adult onset of liver cancer via epigenetic reprogramming mechanisms has been identified. Here, we investigated whether the gut microbiome and liver can be persistently reprogrammed following neonatal exposure to POPs, and the associations between microbial biomarkers and disease-prone changes in the hepatic transcriptome in adulthood, compared with BPA. C57BL/6 male and female mouse pups were orally administered vehicle, BPA, BDE-99 (a breast milk-enriched PBDE congener), or the Fox River PCB mixture (PCBs), once daily for three consecutive days (postnatal days [PND] 2-4). Tissues were collected at PND5 and PND60. Among the three chemicals investigated, early life exposure to BDE-99 produced the most prominent developmental reprogramming of the gut-liver axis, including hepatic inflammatory and cancer-prone signatures. In adulthood, neonatal BDE-99 exposure resulted in a persistent increase in Akkermansia muciniphila throughout the intestine, accompanied by increased hepatic levels of acetate and succinate, the known products of A. muciniphila. In males, this was positively associated with permissive epigenetic marks H3K4me1 and H3K27, which were enriched in loci near liver cancer-related genes that were dysregulated following neonatal exposure to BDE-99.

The anti-hepatoma activity and mechanism of Se-rich RJ in H22 tumor-bearing mice were investigated in the current study. The findings showed that the content of organic and inorganic Se in Se-rich RJ was significantly higher than that in RJ. Furthermore, interleukin-2 (IL-2) levels and tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNF-Î±) production in serum were increased and the malondialdehyde (MDA) content in liver was decreased in mice fed RJ and Se-rich RJ. 16SrRNA sequencing and serum untargeted metabolomics showed that RJ and Se-rich RJ could modulate the gut microbiota, and fisetin and L-glutathione oxidized were the main anti-tumor components in RJ and Se-rich RJ. Further analysis showed 11-deoxy prostaglandin F1Î² was the specific anti-tumor metabolite in mice treated with Se-rich RJ compared with RJ. The results indicated that RJ and Se-rich RJ could inhibit the expression of PI3K and phosphorylation of AKT, induce cell apoptosis through the activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3, and regulate Bcl-2/Bax expression. RJ and Se-rich RJ also inhibited the expression of COX-2 and VEGF.

"Currently, the global prevalence of obesity among the worlds adult population is about 650 million people, which makes it possible to consider this chronic metabolic disease as a non-infectious pandemic of the 21st century. It has been proven that obesity is associated with several gastroenterological diseases, while the mechanisms of these associations are extremely heterogeneous and multifactorial. Hypertrophy and hyperplasia of adipocytes in obesity lead to a change in the profile of adipokine production (a decrease in adiponectin, an increase in leptin), an increase in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1, 6, 8, tumor necrosis factor ), C-reactive protein, free fatty acids, as well as active forms of oxygen (superoxide radicals, H2O2). All the above induces the development of chronic slowly progressive inflammation, oxidative stress, and insulin resistance. In addition, peptides secreted by adipocytes (adiponectin, leptin, nesfatin-1 and apelin) can modulate gastrointestinal motility, acting both centrally and peripherally. The qualitative and quantitative changes in the intestinal microbiota observed in obese patients (increased Firmicutes and decreased Bacteroidetes) lead to a decrease in the production of short-chain fatty acids and an increase in the intestinal permeability due to disruption of intercellular tight junctions, which leads to increased translocation of bacteria and endotoxins into the systemic circulation.

Curcumin is being investigated for its potential chemosensitivity, but its low oral bioavailability hinders its chemosensitivity effect in vivo. Gut microbiota modulation is considered to contribute to its bioactivities in vivo. In the current study, we demonstrate that curcumin can enhance 5-Fu chemosensitivity in HCC cells in vitro, increase the apoptosis rate, arrest the cell cycle at G2/M phase, and block the PI3k/AKT/mTOR signalling pathway by inhibiting the phosphorylation of PI3K and its downstream protein kinases. Curcumin also remarkably sensitized H22 cells to 5-Fu, allowing it to inhibit tumour growth in vivo. 16S rDNA sequencing suggests that curcumin in combination with 5-Fu significantly alters the gut microbiota composition based on alpha and beta diversity analysis compared to drug treatment alone. Gut microbiota depletion abolished curcumin's chemosensitivity effect in vivo. A pharmacodynamics study suggested that the gut microbiota increased the oral bioavailability of curcumin (AUC<sub>(0-t)</sub> 15.24â€‰Â±â€‰0.77â€‰Î¼M/h [wt] vs. 3.04â€‰Â±â€‰0.18â€‰Î¼M/h [gut microbiota depleted]).

The gut microbiota can modulate the host xenobiotic biotransformation and contribute to the development of obesity. While the male sex confers a higher risk for NAFLD than women before menopause, the mechanism remains unknown. We hypothesized that the presence of PXR promotes obesity by modifying the gut-liver axis in a sex-specific manner. Male and female C57BL/6 (wild-type/WT) and PXR-knockout (PXR-KO) mice were fed control or high-fat diet (HFD) for 16-weeks.

"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), characterized by excessive fat deposition in the liver unrelated to alcohol consumption, is highly prevalent worldwide. However, effective therapeutic agents approved for NAFLD treatment are lacking. An ileal bile acid transporter inhibitor (IBATi), which represents a new mode of treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation, leads to increased delivery of bile acids to the colon. We investigated the effect of IBATi against NAFLD through modification of the gut microbiota in mice. IBATi treatment significantly suppressed body weight gain, liver dysfunction, and serum low-density lipoprotein levels and significantly decreased NAFLD activity scores in high-fat diet (HFD) mice. Treatment with IBATi ameliorated the decreased hepatic cholesterol 7-a-monooxygenase (<i>Cyp7a1</i>) and increased ileal fibroblast growth factor 15 (<i>Fgf15</i>) mRNA expression in HFD mice.

Studies have found that the gut-liver-immune axis plays an important role in the progression of NASH. Gut microbiota can use its metabolites to induce glycolipid toxicity, oxidative stress and intestinal barrier damage, while bacterial components such as lipopolysaccharides, peptidoglycans, bacterial DNA and extracellular vesicles can translocate into the liver through the damaged intestinal barrier, causing excessive activation of immune cells, thus aggravating liver inflammation and promoting the progress of NASH.

"Alcoholic fatty liver disease (AFLD) is characterized by hepatic steatosis and carries an elevated risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the mechanism of AFLD has not been elucidated thoroughly, and there are still no efficient therapies in clinic. Notably, butyrate, one kind of short-chain fatty acids produced by gut microbiota, has been shown to improve methionine-choline-deficient diet-induced non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. And our previous study found that butyrate ameliorated endotoxemia in <i>db/db</i> mice. In this study, we aimed to explore the role of butyrate in the development of AFLD. C57BL/6 mice were treated with saline (normal control), alcohol with or without butyrate by gavage for 6 months. AFLD was evaluated by the levels of serum alcohol, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), triglyceride (TG) and intrahepatic TG. And the histology and inflammation in liver and colon were analyzed using hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining, immunohistochemistry and western blot. In addition, gut microbiota composition was analyzed using the V3-V4 regions of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene by sequence. Furthermore, we performed <i>in vitro</i> experiment to verify the role of butyrate in hepatocyte by western blot and transmission electron microscopy. We found that butyrate ameliorated alcohol-induced hepatic steatosis and inflammation. Furthermore, chronic alcohol feeding induced dysbiosis and dysfunction of the gut microbiota, disrupted the intestinal barrier, and increased serum endotoxin levels. Meanwhile, butyrate improved the intestinal barrier disruption and endotoxemia induced by alcohol, but did not significantly alleviate the microbiome dysfunction. Mechanistically, butyrate ameliorated AFLD by inhibiting gasdermin D (GSDMD)-mediated pyroptosis. In summary, we found butyrate ameliorated alcoholic fatty liver by down-regulating GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis.

"The gut-liver axis has attracted much interest in the context of chronic liver disease pathogenesis. Prebiotics such as dietary fibers were shown to attenuate non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) by modulating gut microbiota. Partially hydrolyzed guar gum (PHGG), a water-soluble dietary fiber, has been reported to alleviate the symptoms of various intestinal diseases and metabolic syndromes. However, its effects on NAFLD remain to be fully elucidated. To determine whether treatment with PHGG attenuates NAFLD development in mice through the gut-liver axis. Seven-week-old male C57BL/6J mice with increased intestinal permeability were fed a control or atherogenic (Ath) diet (a mouse model of NAFLD) for 8 wk, with or without 5% PHGG. Increased intestinal permeability was induced through chronic intermittent administration of low-dose dextran sulfate sodium. Body weight, liver weight, macroscopic findings in the liver, blood biochemistry [aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), total cholesterol, triglyceride, free fatty acids, and glucose levels], liver histology, myeloperoxidase activity in liver tissue, mRNA expression in the liver and intestine, serum endotoxin levels in the portal vein, intestinal permeability, and microbiota and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) profiles in the cecal samples were investigated. Mice with increased intestinal permeability subjected to the Ath diet showed significantly increased serum AST and ALT levels, liver fat accumulation, liver inflammatory (tumor necrosis factor-Î± and monocyte chemotactic protein-1) and fibrogenic (collagen 1a1 and Î± smooth muscle actin) marker levels, and liver myeloperoxidase activity, which were significantly attenuated by PHGG treatment. Furthermore, the Ath diet combined with increased intestinal permeability resulted in elevated portal endotoxin levels and activated toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 and TLR9 expression, confirming that intestinal permeability was significantly elevated, as observed by evaluating the lumen-to-blood clearance of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated dextran. PHGG treatment did not affect fatty acid metabolism in the liver. However, it decreased lipopolysaccharide signaling through the gut-liver axis. In addition, it significantly increased the abundance of cecal <i>Bacteroides</i> and <i>Clostridium</i> subcluster XIVa. Treatment with PHGG markedly increased the levels of SCFAs, particularly, butyric acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, and formic acid, in the cecal samples.

"Gut microbiota has a number of essential roles in nutrition metabolism and immune homeostasis, and is closely related to hepatocellular progression. In recent years, studies have also shown that FK506 binding protein 5 (FKBP-5) plays a crucial role in immune regulation. However, it is not yet clear whether FKBP-5 promotes the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by affecting immune function and gut microbiota. FKBP-5 expression was verified by immunochemistry and western blot and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assays. After treatment in WT and FKBP-5<sup>-/-</sup> mice, the histological characteristic of mice liver tissue was assessed by H&E staining, and hepatic leukocytes and hepatic NKT cells were identified by flow cytometer. Meanwhile, primary bile acids (BAs), secondary BAs, serum total cholesterol, and the weight of abdomen adipose tissues were examined, and the gut microbiota was evaluated by 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) sequencing. We discovered that FKBP-5 was highly expressed in HCC tissues. Meanwhile, FKBP-5 deletion inhibited tumor progression by increasing CD<sup>8+</sup> T, CD<sup>4+</sup> T, NKT and CD<sup>4+</sup>NKT cells in mice after diethylnitrosamine (DEN) injection. Besides, we proved that FKBP-5 deletion generated rapid and significant reductions in the intestinal BAs, the weight of abdomen adipose tissues and the serum total cholesterol. FKBP-5 deletion also led to a change in the composition of gut microbiota, suggesting that BAs are the main dietary factor regulating gut microbiota, which could be affected by FKBP-5 deletion. Further, we uncovered that anti-CD4 and anti-CD8 treatments facilitated hepatocellular progression by modulating gut microbiota composition in FKBP-5<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Therefore, we demonstrated that FKBP-5 deletion inhibited hepatocellular progression by modulating immune response and gut microbiome-mediated BAs metabolism."

In the present study, Mdr2 -/- mice were used as a model of inflammation-based HCC. Gut microbiome composition and function, in addition to serum LPS, serum cytokines/chemokines and intrahepatic inflammatory genes were measured throughout the course of liver injury until HCC development. Early stages of liver injury, inflammation and cirrhosis, were characterized by dysbiosis. Microbiome functional pathways pertaining to gut barrier dysfunction were enriched during the initial phase of liver inflammation and cirrhosis, whilst those supporting lipopolysaccharide (LPS) biosynthesis increased as cirrhosis and HCC ensued. In parallel, serum LPS progressively increased during the course of liver injury, corresponding to a shift towards a systemic Th1/Th17 proinflammatory phenotype. Alongside, the intrahepatic inflammatory gene profile transitioned from a proinflammatory phenotype in the initial phases of liver injury to an immunosuppressed one in HCC. In established HCC, a switch in microbiome function from carbohydrate to amino acid metabolism occurred. In Mdr2 -/- mice, dysbiosis precedes HCC development, with temporal evolution of microbiome function to support gut barrier dysfunction, LPS biosynthesis, and redirection of energy source utilization. A corresponding shift in systemic and intrahepatic inflammatory responses occurred supporting HCC development. These findings support the notion that gut based therapeutic interventions could be beneficial early in the course of liver disease to halt HCC development."

Si Miao Formula (SMF) is a classical TCM formula for the treatment of gout disease by reducing serum uric acid concentrations, while high concentration of uric acid is also an independent risk factor for NAFLD. To investigate the protective effect of SMF on NAFLD in a mouse model induced by a high fat/high sucrose (HFHS) diet. Mice received a HFHS diet over a 16-week period to induce NAFLD with or without SMF intervention. Lipid levels were measured in both the liver and serum. Histopathological staining was used to evaluate the extent of hepatic lipid accumulation. Liver transcriptomics was used to enrich differentially expressed genes and to predict regulatory pathways after gene set enrichment analysis. 16S rRNA gene sequencing was used to determine the microbial composition. Genes of liver lipid metabolism, inflammation and intestinal tight junctions were detected by qRT-PCR analysis. SMF attenuated hepatic steatosis, reduced body weight gain and lipid concentrations, improved sensitivity to insulin and also tolerance to glucose, in mice fed an HFHS diet. Hepatic transcriptomics showed that SMF downregulated the biosynthesis of fatty acids and stimulated the insulin secretion pathway. SMF significantly altered the gut microbiota composition and in particular increased the proportion of Akkermansia muciniphila. In agreement with liver transcriptomics, SMF downregulated the expression of genes implicated in the metabolism of lipids (Acly, Fas, Acc, Scd-1) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (Il-1Î², Nlrp-3) in the livers. The results indicate that SMF attenuates HFHS diet-induced NAFLD and regulates hepatic lipid metabolism pathways.

"Key hepatic molecules linking gut dysbiosis and hepatocarcinogenesis remain largely unknown. Gut-derived gut microbiota contains pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that may circulate into the liver and, consequently, be recognized by hepatic pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). NOD2, a general intracellular PRR, recognizes muramyl dipeptide (MDP), present in both gram (+) and gram (-) bacteria. Here, we investigated the role of NOD2 as a molecular sensor translating gut dysbiosis signaling into hepatocarcinogenesis. NOD2 expression was measured in clinical hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) samples using qPCR (80 pairs), western blotting (30 pairs) and immunostaining (141 pairs). The role of NOD2 in hepatocarcinogenesis was examined in the hepatocyte-specific Nod2-knockout (Nod2<sup>â–³hep</sup>), Rip2-knockout (Rip2<sup>â–³hep</sup>), Lamin A/C-knockout (Lamn<sup>â–³hep</sup>) and Rip2/Lamin A/C double-knockout (Rip2/Lamn<sup>â–³hep</sup>) mice models of diethylnitrosamine (DEN)/CCl<sub>4</sub>-induced HCC. NOD2 was upregulated and activated in HCC samples, and high NOD2 expression correlated with poor prognosis in HCC patients. Hepatic NOD2 deletion in vivo decreased DEN/CCl<sub>4</sub>-induced HCC by reducing the inflammatory response, DNA damage and genomic instability. NOD2 activation increased liver inflammation via RIP2-dependent activation of the MAPK, NF-ÎºB and STAT3 pathways. Notably, a novel RIP2-independent mechanism was discovered, whereby NOD2 activation induces the nuclear autophagy pathway. We showed that NOD2 undergoes nuclear transport and directly binds to a component of nuclear laminae, lamin A/C, to promote its protein degradation, leading to impaired DNA damage repair and increased genomic instability. We reveal a novel bridge, bacterial sensor NOD2, linking gut-derived microbial metabolites to hepatocarcinogenesis via induction of the inflammatory response and nuclear autophagy. Thus, we propose hepatic NOD2 as a promising therapeutic target against HCC."

Changes in the gut microbiome have been implicated in NASH pathogenesis, but the lack of suitable murine models has been a barrier to progress. We have therefore characterized the microbiome in a well-validated murine NASH model to establish its value in modeling human disease. The composition of intestinal microbiota was monitored in mice on a 12- or 24-week NASH protocol consisting of high fat, high sugar Western Diet (WD) plus once weekly i.p injection of low-dose CCl4. Additional mice were subjected to WD-only or CCl4-only conditions to assess the independent effect of these variables on the microbiome. There was substantial remodeling of the intestinal microbiome in NASH mice, characterized by declines in both species diversity and bacterial abundance. Based on changes to beta diversity, microbiota from NASH mice clustered separately from controls in principal coordinate analyses. A comparison between WD-only and CCl4-only controls with the NASH model identified WD as the primary driver of early changes to the microbiome, resulting in loss of diversity within the 1st week. A NASH signature emerged progressively at weeks 6 and 12, including, most notably, a reproducible bloom of the Firmicute order Erysipelotrichales.

While several surgical interventions and loco-regional treatment options are available, up to 80% of patients present with advanced disease not amenable to standard therapies. Indeed, traditional cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents are notoriously ineffective and essentially play no role in the management of affected patients. This has led to an enormous need for more effective systemic therapeutic options. In recent years, immunotherapy has emerged as a potentially viable and exciting new alternative for the treatment of HCC. Although the current immunotherapeutic options remain imperfect, various strategies can be employed to further improve their efficacy. New findings have revealed epigenetic modulation can be effective as a new approach for improving HCC immunotherapy. Studying the gut microbiome (gut-liver axis) can also be an interesting subject in this regard.

"Gut dysbiosis is commonly observed in patients with cirrhosis and chronic gastrointestinal disorders; however, its effect on antitumor immunity in the liver is largely unknown. Here we studied how the gut microbiome affects antitumor immunity in cholangiocarcinoma. Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) or colitis, two known risk factors for cholangiocarcinoma which promote tumor development in mice, caused an accumulation of CXCR2<sup>+</sup> polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSC). A decrease in gut barrier function observed in mice with PSC and colitis allowed gut-derived bacteria and lipopolysaccharide to appear in the liver and induced CXCL1 expression in hepatocytes through a TLR4-dependent mechanism and an accumulation of CXCR2<sup>+</sup> PMN-MDSCs. In contrast, neomycin treatment blocked CXCL1 expression and PMN-MDSC accumulation and inhibited tumor growth even in the absence of liver disease or colitis. Our study demonstrates that the gut microbiome controls hepatocytes to form an immunosuppressive environment by increasing PMN-MDSCs to promote liver cancer. SIGNIFICANCE: MDSCs have been shown to be induced by tumors and suppress antitumor immunity. Here we show that the gut microbiome can control accumulation of MDSCs in the liver in the context of a benign liver disease or colitis.<i>See related commentary by Chagani and Kwong, p. 1014</i>.<i>This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 995</i>."

Gut microbiota have been revealed playing an important role in the pathogenesis of NAFLD. Sheng-Jiang Powder (SJP), an empirical Chinese medicine formula to treat NAFLD, showed great hepatoprotective properties, but the impact on gut microbiota has never been identified. Therefore, we performed this study to investigate the effect of SJP on gut microbiota in NAFLD mice. NAFLD was induced by 12 weeks' high-fat diet (HFD) feeding. Mice were treated with SJP/normal saline daily for 6 weeks. Blood samples were obtained for serum biochemical indices and inflammatory cytokines measurement. Liver tissues were obtained for pathological evaluation and oil red O staining. The expression of lipid metabolism-related genes was quantified by RT-PCR and Western blotting. Changes in gut microbiota composition were analyzed by the 16s rDNA sequencing technique. HFD feeding induced significant increase in bodyweight and serum levels of TG, TC, ALT, and AST. The pathological examination revealed obvious hepatic steatosis in HFD feeding mice. Coadministration of SJP effectively protected against bodyweight increase and lipid accumulation in blood and liver. Increased expression of PPAR<i>Î³</i> mRNA was observed in HFD feeding mice, but a steady elevation of PPAR<i>Î³</i> protein level was only found in SJP-treated mice. Meanwhile, the expression of FASN was much higher in HFD feeding mice. Microbiome analysis revealed obvious changes in gut microbiota composition among diverse groups. SJP treatment modulated the relative abundance of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) producing bacteria, including norank-f-<i>Erysipelotrichaceae</i> and <i>Roseburia</i>.

We further verified the potential of the gut microbiota to predict clinical outcome by a random forest model and a support vector machine model. We found that Bacteroides, Lachnospiracea incertae sedis, and Clostridium XIVa were enriched in HCC patients with a high tumor burden. By integrating the microbiome and transcriptome, we identified 31 robust associations between the above three genera and well-characterized genes, indicating possible mechanistic relationships in tumor immune microenvironment. Clinical characteristics and database analysis suggested that serum bile acids may be important communication mediators between these three genera and the host transcriptome.

Although the link between intestinal dysbiosis and chronic liver disease is well-established, there is little evidence for a functional role of gut-liver interaction during ALF. Here we hypothesized that intestinal dysbiosis may affect ALF. To test this hypothesis, we assessed the association of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) or long-term antibiotics (ABx) intake, which have both been linked to intestinal dysbiosis, and occurrence of ALF in the 500,000 participants of the UK BioBank population-based cohort. For functional studies, male Nlrp6<sup>-/-</sup> mice were used as a dysbiotic mouse model and injected with a sublethal dose of acetaminophen (APAP) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to induce ALF. Multivariate Cox regression analyses revealed a significantly increased risk (odds ratio, 2.3-3) for developing ALF in UK BioBank participants with PPI or ABx. Similarly, dysbiotic Nlrp6<sup>-/-</sup> mice displayed exacerbated APAP- and LPS-induced liver injury, which was linked to significantly reduced gut and liver tissue microbiota diversity and correlated with increased intestinal permeability at baseline. Fecal microbiota transfer (FMT) from Nlrp6<sup>-/-</sup> mice into wild-type (WT) mice augmented liver injury on APAP treatment in recipient WT mice, resembling the inflammatory phenotype of Nlrp6<sup>-/-</sup> mice.

From the viewpoint of pathophysiology, cellular stress responses, including autophagy and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, are involved in the development of cellular injury in steatohepatitis.

Liver injury, immune inflammatory function and intestinal barrier function were evaluated. The fecal microbiome and metabolome were studied using 16S rRNA absolute quantification sequencing and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.

Given that most gut bacteria are highly dependent on iron for survival, we postulated that, by reducing gut iron levels, venesection could alter the gut microbiota. Clinical parameters, faecal bacterial composition and metabolomes were assessed before and during treatment in a group of patients with haemochromatosis undergoing iron reduction therapy. Systemic iron reduction was associated with an alteration of the gut microbiome, with changes evident in those who experienced reduced faecal iron availability with venesection. For example, levels of <i>Faecalibacterium prausnitzii</i>, a bacterium associated with improved colonic health, were increased in response to faecal iron reduction. Similarly, metabolomic changes were seen in association with reduced faecal iron levels. These findings highlight a significant shift in the gut microbiome of patients who experience reduced colonic iron during venesection. Targeted depletion of faecal iron could represent a novel therapy for metabolic and inflammatory diseases, meriting further investigation. Iron depletion by repeated venesection is the mainstay of treatment for haemochromatosis, an iron-overload disorder. Venesection has been associated with several health benefits, including improvements in liver function tests, reversal of liver scarring, and reduced risk of liver cancer. During iron depletion, iron absorption from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract increases to compensate for iron lost with treatment. Iron availability is limited in the GI tract and is crucial to the growth and function of many gut bacteria.

Gut microbiota was analysed by 16S rRNA sequencing and serum metabolites by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) metabolomic analysis. Faecal microbial compositions were examined in 59 hypercholesterolemia patients and 39 healthy controls. High dietary cholesterol led to the sequential progression of steatosis, steatohepatitis, fibrosis and eventually HCC in mice, concomitant with insulin resistance. Cholesterol-induced NAFLD-HCC formation was associated with gut microbiota dysbiosis. The microbiota composition clustered distinctly along stages of steatosis, steatohepatitis and HCC. <i>Mucispirillum, Desulfovibrio, Anaerotruncus</i> and <i>Desulfovibrionaceae</i> increased sequentially; while <i>Bifidobacterium</i> and <i>Bacteroides</i> were depleted in HFHC-fed mice, which was corroborated in human hypercholesteremia patients. Dietary cholesterol induced gut bacterial metabolites alteration including increased taurocholic acid and decreased 3-indolepropionic acid.

Although we do not know the exact mechanisms by which only a selected group of patients with ALD progress to the final stage of HCC, the role of the gut microbiota within the progression to HCC has been intensively studied in recent years. To date, we know that alcohol-induced gut dysbiosis is an important feature of ALD with important repercussions on the severity of this disease. In essence, an increased metabolism of ethanol in the gut induced by an excessive alcohol consumption promotes gut dysfunction and bacterial overgrowth, setting a leaky gut. This causes the translocation of bacteria, endotoxins, and ethanol metabolites across the enterohepatic circulation reaching the liver, where the recognition of the pathogen-associated molecular patterns via specific Toll-like receptors of liver cells will induce the activation of the nuclear factor kappa-B pathway, which releases pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. In addition, the mitogenic activity of hepatocytes will be promoted and cellular apoptosis will be inhibited, resulting in the development of HCC. In this context, it is not surprising that microbiota-regulating drugs have proven effectiveness in prolonging the overall survival of patients with HCC, making attractive the implementation of these drugs as co-adjuvant for HCC treatment."

Determining the molecular pathways that are either over expressed or repressed during inulin-induced HCC would provide a platform of potential therapeutic targets. In the present study, we have combined analysis of the novel inulin-induced HCC murine model and human HCC samples to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in hepatocarcinogenesis. Hepatic transcriptome profiling revealed that there were 674 DEGs in HCC mice compared to mice safeguarded from HCC. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis uncovered enrichment in ECM-receptor interaction, steroid hormone biosynthesis, PPAR signaling pathway, focal adhesion and protein digestion and absorption during inulin-induced HCC. Tandem mass tag based quantitative, multiplexed proteomic analysis delineated 57 differentially expressed proteins, where the over-expressed proteins were associated with cell adhesion molecules, valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation and ECM-receptor interaction. After obtaining the human orthologs of the mouse genes, we did a comparison analysis to level 3 RNA-seq data found in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, corresponding to human HCC (n = 361) and healthy liver (n = 50) samples. Out of the 549 up-regulated and 68 down-regulated human orthologs identified, 142 genes (137 significantly over-expressed and 5 significantly under-expressed) were associated with human HCC. Using univariate survival analysis, we found 27 over-expressed genes involved in cell-cell adhesion and cell division that were associated with poor HCC patient survival.

Nonetheless, despite the clear impact of DCA and LCA on host physiology, an incomplete knowledge of their biosynthetic genes and a lack of genetic tools to enable modification of their native microbial producers limit our ability to modulate secondary bile acid levels in the host. Here we complete the pathway to DCAÂ andÂ LCA by assigning and characterizing enzymes for each of the steps in its reductive arm, revealing a strategy in which the A-B rings of the steroid core are transiently converted into an electron acceptor for two reductive steps carried out by Fe-S flavoenzymes.

Gut microbiota plays a key role in liver diseases; however, its association with HCC remains elusive. This study aimed to elucidate microbial differences between patients with HCC-associated cirrhosis (HCC-cirrhosis) and cirrhotic patients without HCC and healthy volunteers and to explore the associations between diet, lifestyle, and the microbiome of these patients. Fecal samples and food frequency questionnaires were collected from 95 individuals (30 HCC-cirrhosis patients, 38 cirrhotic patients without HCC, and 27 age- and body mass index [BMI]-matched healthy volunteers). 16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed. Bacterial richness in cirrhosis and HCC-cirrhosis patients was significantly lower than in healthy controls. The HCC-cirrhosis group was successfully classified with an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.9 based on the dysbiotic fecal microbial signature. The HCC-cirrhosis group had a significant overrepresentation of <i>Clostridium</i> and <i>CF231</i> and reduced <i>Alphaproteobacteria</i> abundance compared to cirrhotic patients without HCC.

This study demonstrates that reduced bacterial richness and dysbiosis escalate with the progression of cirrhosis from compensated to decompensated cirrhosis and to HCC-associated cirrhosis (HCC-cirrhosis). Moreover, we report for the first time the effect of environmental factors on HCC-cirrhosis. Excess weight was associated with increased dysbiosis in patients with HCC compared to their normal-weight counterparts. Moreover, fatty liver, consumption of artificial sweeteners, and high-sugar foods were associated with altered microbial composition, including altered levels of <i>Akkermansia muciniphila</i> in HCC-cirrhosis.

Bile acids are metabolites, derived from cholesterol and synthesized in the liver, which may have a critical role in regulation of the gut-liver axis. We investigated whether prediagnostic circulating bile acids were associated with HCC risk, using the Risk Evaluation of Viral Load Elevation and Associated Liver Disease/Cancer (REVEAL)-Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) and REVEAL-Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) cohorts from Taiwan. Fifteen bile acids were quantitated using liquid chromatography, from 185 cases and 161 matched controls in REVEAL-HBV and 96 cases and 96 matched controls in REVEAL-HCV. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for associations between bile acid levels and HCC were calculated using multivariable-adjusted logistic regression.

"Liver fibrosis often appears in chronic liver disease, with extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition as the main feature. Due to the presence of the liver-gut axis, the destruction of intestinal homeostasis is often accompanied by the development of liver fibrosis. The inconsistent ecological environment of different intestinal sites may lead to differences in the microbiota. The traditional Chinese medicine ursolic acid (UA) has been proven to protect the liver from fibrosis. We investigated the changes in the microbiota of different parts of the intestine during liver fibrosis and the effect of UA on these changes based on high-throughput sequencing technology. Sequencing results suggest that the diversity and abundance of intestinal microbiota decline and the composition of the microbiota is disordered, the potentially beneficial Firmicutes bacteria are reduced, and the pathways for functional prediction are changed in the ilea and anal faeces of liver fibrosis mice compared with normal mice. However, in UA-treated liver fibrosis mice, these disorders improved. It is worth noting that the bacterial changes in the ilea and anal faeces are not consistent. In conclusion, in liver fibrosis, the microbiota of different parts of the intestines have different degrees of disorder, and UA can improve this disorder. This may be a potential mechanism for UA to achieve anti-fibrosis. This study provides theoretical guidance for the UA targeting of intestinal microbiota for the treatment of liver fibrosis."

"The precipitous increase in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is accompanied by a dramatic increase in the incidence of NASH-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HCC in NASH has a higher propensity to arise without pre-existing cirrhosis compared with other chronic liver diseases. To identify the potential links between liver and gut in NASH-related hepatocarcinogenesis, we compared the gut microbiota and mediators of bile acid (BA) signaling in the absence or presence of cirrhosis through the analysis of stool and serum samples from patients with NASH non-HCC and NASH-HCC and healthy volunteers. Serum levels of total and individual BA were higher in NASH compared with healthy controls. Furthermore, serum levels of the primary conjugated BAs glycine-conjugated cholic acid, taurine-conjugated cholic acid, glycine-conjugated chenodeoxycholic acid, and taurine-conjugated chenodeoxycholic acid were significantly increased in cirrhotic vs noncirrhotic patients, independent of the occurrence of HCC. By contrast, serum FGF19 levels were higher in patients with NASH-HCC and associated with tumor markers as well as an attenuation of BA synthesis. Specific alterations in the gut microbiome were found for several bacteria involved in the BA metabolism including Bacteroides and Lactobacilli. Specifically, the abundance of Lactobacilli was associated with progressive disease, serum BA levels, and liver injury in NASH and NASH-HCC. Here, we demonstrate a clear association of the altered gut microbiota and primary conjugated BA composition in cirrhotic and noncirrhotic patients with NASH-HCC. Microbiota-associated alterations in BA homeostasis and farnesoid X receptor signaling, via FGF19, might thus contribute to fibrogenesis, liver injury, and tumorigenesis in NASH-HCC."

In this study, we aimed to characterize gut dysbiosis of LC-HCC and NLC-HCC to elucidate the role of GM in the pathogenesis of HCC. A consecutive series of fecal samples of patients with hepatitis (24 patients), liver cirrhosis (24 patients), HCC (75 patients: 35 infected by HBV, 25 infected by HCV, and 15 with alcoholic liver disease), and healthy controls (20 patients) were obtained and sequenced on the Illumina Hiseq platform. The HCC group contains 52 LC-HCC and 23 NLC-HCC. Bioinformatic analysis of the intestinal microbiota was performed with QIIME and MicrobiomeAnalyst. Alpha-diversity analysis showed that fecal microbial diversity was significantly decreased in the LC group, and there were significant differences in 3 phyla and 27 genera in the LC group vs the other groups (the healthy, hepatitis, and HCC groups). Beta-diversity analysis showed that there were large differences between LC and the others. Gut microbial diversity was significantly increased from LC to HCC. Characterizing the fecal microbiota of LC-HCC and NLC-HCC, we found that microbial diversity was increased from LC to LC-HCC rather than NLC-HCC. Thirteen genera were discovered to be associated with the tumor size of HCC. Three biomarkers (Enterococcus, Limnobacter, and Phyllobacterium) could be used for precision diagnosis. We also found that HBV infection, HCV infection, or ALD (alcoholic liver disease) was not associated with intestinal microbial dysbiosis in HCC.

Plasma bile acid levels were measured in 390 subjects. These subjects were screened with liver elastography, detecting significant liver fibrosis in 58 subjects and steatosis in 186 subjects. Unsupervised clustering of the bile acid profiles revealed five clusters that differed by liver fibrosis, liver steatosis, liver injury, age and gender, identifying these parameters as major determinants of circulating bile acid changes. Total bile acid levels were significantly higher in subjects with fibrosis, with chenodeoxycholic acid displaying the greatest increase among individual bile acids. The primary conjugated bile acids, glycocholic and glycochenodeoxycholic acids, displayed the strongest association with fibrosis by logistic regression. High lithocholic acid levels were strongly associated with advanced fibrosis. In contrast, deoxycholic acid and total unconjugated secondary bile acids were positively associated with steatosis, whereas relative glycoursodeoxycholic acid abundance was negatively associated.

The microbiota-derived Staphylococcal superantigen-like protein 6 (SSL6) inhibited CD47 and promoted SFN-induced apoptosis of HCC cells Huh-7 and MHCC97H. Mechanistically, the sensitivity of HCC cells to SFN was inhibited by elevated Warburg effect (glycolysis), and SSL6 down-regulated PI3K/Akt-mediated glycolysis by blocking CD47. Knockdown of CD47 also dampened glycolysis and sensitized HCC cells to SFN. Moreover, SFN-resistant HCC cells exhibited enhanced glycolysis and CD47 expression.

Therefore, we hypothesized that clearance of bacterial taxa, and thereby gut metabolites, involved in the onset and progression to liver cancer could abate the disease in these mice. Such a reshaping of microbiota by vancomycin treatment was sufficient to halt the development of liver cancer in inulin-fed T5KO mice; however, this intervention did not remedy disease penetrance for cholestatic liver injury and its sequelae, including hyperbilirubinemia, hypolipidemia, cholemia and liver fibrosis. Selective depletion of gut bacterial communities was observed in vancomycin-treated mice, including Gram-positive <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> and <i>Ruminococcaceae</i> belonging to the phylum Firmicutes, <i>Bifidobacteria</i> of the phylum Actinobacteria, which ferment fibers, and Clostridium cluster XIVa, which produce secondary bile acids.

In particular, a subset of Toll-like receptor 5-deficient (T5KO) mice prone to HCC exhibited rapid onset of hyperbilirubinemia (HB) and cholemia; these symptoms provide rationale that ICD induces cholestasis. Our objective in the present study was to determine whether inulin-fed T5KO-HB mice exhibit other known consequences of cholestasis, including essential fatty acid and fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies. Here, we measured hepatic fatty acids and serum vitamin A and D levels from wild-type (WT), T5KO low bilirubin (LB) and T5KO-HB mice fed ICD for 4 wk. Additionally, hepatic RNAseq and proteomics were performed to ascertain other metabolic alterations. Compared with WT and T5KO-LB, T5KO-HB mice exhibited steatorrhea, i.e., ~50% increase in fecal lipids. This could contribute to the significant reduction of linoleate in hepatic neutral lipids in T5KO-HB mice.

"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is a rapidly rising problem in the 21st century and is a leading cause of chronic liver disease that can lead to end-stage liver diseases, including cirrhosis and hepatocellular cancer. Despite this rising epidemic, no pharmacological treatment has yet been established to treat this disease. The rapidly increasing prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and its aggressive form, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), requires novel therapeutic approaches to prevent disease progression. Alterations in microbiome dynamics and dysbiosis play an important role in liver disease and may represent targetable pathways to treat liver disorders. Improving microbiome properties or restoring normal bile acid metabolism may prevent or slow the progression of liver diseases such as NASH. Importantly, aberrant systemic circulation of bile acids can greatly disrupt metabolic homeostasis. Bile acid sequestrants are orally administered polymers that bind bile acids in the intestine, forming nonabsorbable complexes. Bile acid sequestrants interrupt intestinal reabsorption of bile acids, decreasing their circulating levels. We determined that treatment with the bile acid sequestrant sevelamer reversed the liver injury and prevented the progression of NASH, including steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis in a Western diet-induced NASH mouse model. Metabolomics and microbiome analysis revealed that this beneficial effect is associated with changes in the microbiota population and bile acid composition, including reversing microbiota complexity in cecum by increasing <i>Lactobacillus</i> and decreased <i>Desulfovibrio</i> The net effect of these changes was improvement in liver function and markers of liver injury and the positive effects of reversal of insulin resistance."

Etiologies for liver disease included non-alcoholic liver disease (58.0%), hepatitis C (26.0%), hepatitis B (10.0%), and alcohol (6.0%).

Prevotella copri, which was enriched in patients with advanced fibrosis, was the most strongly predictive microbe in the classifier. The classifier had an AUROC of 0.82 for advanced fibrosis in the validation cohort and Prevotella copri remained the strongest predictive microbe for advanced fibrosis.

Similarly, the HF group exhibited an increase in hepatic lipid droplets, inflammatory cell infiltration, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and hepatocellular ballooning (but without hepatic Mallory bodies) which are key histological features of advanced hepatic steatosis. Furthermore, RNA sequencing, qPCR and immunohistological methods found that nicotinamide n-methyltransferase and selenoprotein P, two inflammation-related hepatic genes, were upregulated in the HF group. Consistent with the hepatic inflammation, the levels of proinflammatory plasma-cytokines (TNF-Î± and IL6), colonic secondary BAs (LCA, DCA) and secondary BA producing bacteria (e.g., lactobacillaceae/Lachnospiraceae) were at least 0.5-fold greater in the HF group compared with the LF group.

CBCs and expression profiles suggested a non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)-related pathology associated to comorbid cardiac diseases. The characterization of 16S sequencing data was less straightforward, suggesting only a potential weak link to obesity. The integration of the datasets identified several fine-scale associations between CBCs, gene expression, and faecal microbiota composition. NAFLD is a common cause of chronic liver disease in Western countries and is linked to obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiac pathologies.

"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. The prognosis of HCC remains very poor; thus, an effective treatment remains urgent. Herein, a type of nanomedicine is developed by conjugating Fe@Fe<sub>3</sub> O<sub>4</sub> nanoparticles with ginsenoside Rg3 (NpRg3), which achieves an excellent coupling effect. In the dimethylnitrosamine-induced HCC model, NpRg3 application significantly prolongs the survival of HCC mice. Further research indicates that NpRg3 application significantly inhibits HCC development and eliminates HCC metastasis to the lung. Notably, NpRg3 application delays HCC-induced ileocecal morphology and gut microbial alterations more than 12 weeks during HCC progression. NpRg3 administration elevates the abundance of Bacteroidetes and Verrucomicrobia, but decreases Firmicutes. Twenty-nine predicted microbial gene functions are enriched, while seven gene functions are reduced after NpRg3 administration. Moreover, the metabolomics profile presents a significant progression during HCC development, but NpRg3 administration corrects tumor-dominant metabolomics. NpRg3 administration decreases 3-indolepropionic acid and urea, but elevates free fatty acids.

Obesity and features of the metabolic syndrome have been closely linked to NAFLD development. Due to the increased prevalence of obesity worldwide, NAFLD has reached epidemic proportions over time. Given its unfavorable cardiometabolic burden (such as cardiovascular and metabolic consequences), it represents a worrying phenomenon needing a more comprehensive and successful management. Laboratory tests and classical imaging techniques play a pivotal role in NAFLD diagnosis, but novel noninvasive alternative methods to diagnose and monitor NAFLD have been investigated. Currently, lifestyle modifications remain the mainstay treatment, although its efficacy is poor because of the lack of compliance. Pediatric research is focusing on multiple alternative treatments targeting the main pathogenic factors such as insulin-resistance, dyslipidemia, gut-liver axis and microbiota, oxidative stress, and proinflammatory pathways. Results from these studies are promising but larger validation is needed. Innovative therapeutic approaches might add an important piece in the complex knowledge of pediatric NAFLD.

Here, we investigated the efficacy and mechanism of action of a polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP-k30)-based solid dispersion of Zn(II)-curcumin (ZnCM-SD) against hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in vitro and in vivo. In vitro assays revealed ZnCM-SD not only reduced the viability of HepG2 cells and SK-HEP1 cells in a dose-dependent manner, but also potently and synergistically enhanced cell growth inhibition and cell death in response to doxorubicin by regulating cellular zinc homeostasis. ZnCM-SD was internalized into the cells via non-specific endocytosis and degraded to release curcumin and Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions within cells. The anticancer effects also occur in vivo in animals following the oral administration of ZnCM-SD, without significantly affecting the weight of the animals. Interestingly, ZnCM-SD did not reduce tumor growth or affect zinc homeostasis in HepG2-bearing mice after gut microbiome depletion. Moreover, administration of ZnCM-SD alone or in combination with doxorubicin significantly attenuated gut dysbiosis and zinc dyshomeostasis in a rat HCC model.

Therefore, in this study we aimed to improve our understanding of changes in gut microbiota, BA metabolism, and cytokines in patients with ICC.

However, IL-25 did not directly promote the development of HCC cells. Then, we observed the significant positive correlation between IL-25 level and M2 percentage (CD206/CD68) in HCC tumors. In vitro and in vivo, IL-25 induced alternative activation of macrophages promoted HCC cell migration, invasion and tumorigenesis, increased the expression of vimentin, Snail and phospho-ERK, and decreased the expression of E-cadherin in HCC cells. After IL-25 treatment, chemokine CXCL10 was increased in macrophages. Neutralizing CXCL10 in macrophage-conditioned medium reversed the IL-25-mediated effect on HCC cells. Vancomycin-induced dysbiosis promoted the growth of orthotopic HCC homograft. Surprisedly, we found the hyperplasia of colonic epithelial tuft cells, from which more IL-25 was secreted . IL-25 promotes the progression of HCC through inducing alternative activation and CXCL10 secretion of macrophages in tumor microenvironment, and IL-25 secretion may partly result from hyperplastic epithelial tuft cells in colon, induced by gut microbiota dysbiosis."

Recent studies have evaluated the early diagnosis of primary HCC through analysis of gut microbiota dysbiosis. However, the relationship between the degree of dysbiosis and the prognosis of primary HCC remains unclear. Because primary HCC is accompanied by dysbiosis and dysbiosis usually increases the circulatory concentrations of endotoxin and other harmful bacterial substances, which further increases liver damage, we hypothesized that level of dysbiosis associated with primary HCC increases with the stage of cancer progression. To test this hypothesis, we introduced a more integrated index referred to as the degree of dysbiosis (<i>D<sub>dys</sub></i> ); and we investigated <i>D<sub>dys</sub></i> of the gut microbiota with the development of primary HCC through high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons. Our results showed that compared with healthy individuals, patients with primary HCC showed increased pro-inflammatory bacteria in their fecal microbiota.

Previous studies have demonstrated that urolithins exhibit antiproliferative effects on prostate, breast, and colon cancers. However, as for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), it remains elusive. Herein, we aim to investigate the function of urolithin B (UB), a member of urolithins family, in HCC. The effects of UB on cell viability, cell cycle and apoptosis were evaluated in HCC cells, and we found UB could inhibit the proliferation of HCC cells, which resulted from cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Furthermore, UB could increase phosphorylated Î²-catenin expression and block its translocation from nuclear to cytoplasm, thus inducing the inactivation of Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling. Using a xenograft mice model, UB was found to suppress tumor growth in vivo.

The Farnesoid-x-receptor (FXR) and the G-protein coupled bile acid receptor 1 (GPBAR1), two bile acid activated receptors, have been investigated for their potential in treating NASH. Here we report that BAR502, a steroidal dual ligand for FXR/GPBAR1, attenuates development of clinical and liver histopathology features of NASH in mice fed a high fat diet (HFD) and fructose (F). By RNAseq analysis of liver transcriptome we found that BAR502 restores FXR signaling in the liver of mice feed HFD-F, and negatively regulates a cluster of genes including Srebf1 (Srepb1c) and its target genes-fatty acid synthase (Fasn) and Cell death-inducing DFF45-like effector (CIDE) genes, Cidea and Cidec-involved in lipid droplets formation and triglycerides storage in hepatocytes. Additionally, BAR502 increased the intestinal expression of Fgf15 and Glp1 and energy expenditure by white adipose tissues.

We established a control group, a PLC model group, and a treatment group of mice to analyze the inhibitory effect of SRM on PLC and its intestinal flora target. We also evaluated drug efficacy of SRM and analyzed specific changes in intestinal flora by 16S rDNA sequencing of stools. As the serum interleukin (IL)-10 level could be an independent prognostic factor for unresectable liver cancer, we detected IL-10 levels and analyzed their association with the abundance of specific bacteria. Liver tumors in the treatment group were smaller and fewer than those in the model group ( P = .046). The abundance of Bacteroides was significantly higher in the model group than that in the control group, while SRM significantly reduced the increasing abundance of Bacteroides in mice with PLC. We found that the IL-10 level was positively correlated with the abundance of Bacteroides. SRM can effectively inhibit the progression of PLC and increase Bacteroides abundance.

In the other study, we prospectively determined the abundance of specific bacterial genus in patients with HCC by sequencing 16S ribosomal RNA and assessed its association with survival. Subanalysis of the RCT data showed that, of 26 types of antibiotics used, administration of carbapenem before or during chemotherapy was associated with poor progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of patients with HCC (carbapenem + vs. -; median PFS, 78â€‰days vs. 154â€‰days, pâ€‰=â€‰0.0053; median OS, 177â€‰days vs. 475â€‰days, pâ€‰=â€‰0.0003).

As primary de novo lipogenesis in the liver of chicken is similar to that of humans, mature chicken is an ideal animal model for the understanding of NAFLD. This study was aimed to evaluate the relationships between gut microbiota and natural chronic liver disease (i.e., non-alcoholic steatohepatitis [NASH] and fibrosis stages) in a well-characterized laying hen population. One hundred 20-wk-old Hy-Line Brown laying hens were used and fed with basal diets until 52 wk of age.

In this study, we investigated the differences between the gut microbiota of HBV related HCC (B-HCC) and non-HBV non-HCV related HCC (NBNC-HCC), finally found some potential bacteria, linking different pathological mechanism of both types of HCCs. We carried out 16S rRNA analyses in a cohort of 33 healthy controls, 35 individuals with HBV related HCC (B-HCC) and 22 individuals with non-HBV non-HCV (NBNC) related HCC (NBNC-HCC). We found that the species richness of fecal microbiota of B-HCC patients was much higher than other two groups. Interestingly, the feces of NBNC-HCC patients harbored more potential pro-inflammatory bacteria (<i>Escherichia</i>-<i>Shigella</i>, <i>Enterococcus</i>) and reduced levels of <i>Faecalibacterium</i>, <i>Ruminococcus</i>, <i>Ruminoclostridium</i> which results in decrease potential of anti-inflammatory short-chain fatty acids. The feces of NBNC-HCC patients had relatively fewer abundance of multiple biological pathways related to amino acid and glucose metabolism, but high level of transport and secretion in some types. However, the B-HCC patients had opposite results of bacterial composition and associated multiple biological pathways versus NBNC-HCC patients. Meanwhile, we found that aberrant network of gut microbiota occurred differently in B-HCC and NBNC-HCC patients. Our study indicated that B-HCC and NBNC-HCC patients showed differential abundance of bacteria involved in different functions or biological pathways. We suggested the modification of specific gut microbiota may provide the therapeutic benefit for B-HCC and NBNC-HCC."

High-throughput pyrosequencing of 16S rDNA was used to identify differences in gut bacterial diversity among HC, LC, and PLC groups. We also analyzed the relationship between clinical factors and intestinal microorganisms in LC and PLC groups. Diversity of Firmicutes tended to decrease from the HC to LC and PLC groups at the phylum level. Among species, Enterobacter ludwigii displayed an increasing trend in the PLC group, wherein the relative abundance of Enterobacter ludwigii in the PLC group was 100 times greater than that in the HC and LC groups. The ratio of Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes was significantly decreased with the disease progression. In addition, the linear discriminant analysis effect size method indicated that Clostridia were predominant in the gut microbiota of the HC group, whereas Enterococcaceae, Lactobacillales, Bacilli and Gammaproteobacteria may be used as diagnostic markers of PLC. Redundancy analysis showed a correlation between intestinal microbial diversity and clinical factors AST, ALT, and AFP.

"Cholestasis is a major hepatic disease in infants, with increasing morbidity in recent years. Accumulating evidence has revealed that the gut microbiota (GM) is associated with liver diseases, such as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. However, GM alterations in cholestatic infants and the correlation between the GM and hepatic functions remain uninvestigated. In this study, 43 cholestatic infants (IC group) and 37 healthy infants (H group) were enrolled to detect GM discrepancies using 16S rDNA analysis. The diversity in the bacterial community was significantly lower in the IC group than that in the H group (<i>P</i> = 0.013). After determining the top 10 abundant genera of microbes in the IC and H groups, we found that 13 of them were differentially enriched, including <i>Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides, Streptococcus, Enterococcus</i>, and <i>Staphylococcus</i>. As compared with the H group, the IC group had a more complex GM co-occurrence network featured by three core nodes: <i>Phyllobacterium, Ruminococcus</i>, and <i>Anaerostipes</i>. In addition, the positive correlation between <i>Faecalibacterium</i> and <i>Erysipelatoclostridium</i> (<i>r</i> = 0.689, <i>P</i> = 0.000, FDR = 0.009) was not observed in the IC patients. Using the GM composition, the cholestatic patients can be distinguished from healthy infants with high accuracy [areas under receiver operating curve (AUC) > 0.97], wherein <i>Rothia, Eggerthella, Phyllobacterium</i>, and <i>Blautia</i> are identified as valuable biomarkers. Using KEGG annotation, we identified 32 functional categories with significant difference in enrichment of the GM of IC patients, including IC-enriched functional categories that were related to lipid metabolism, biodegradation and metabolism of xenobiotics, and various diseases. In contrast, the number of functions associated with amino acid metabolism, nucleotide metabolism, and vitamins metabolism was reduced in the IC patients. We also identified significant correlation between GM composition and indicators of hepatic function. <i>Megasphaera</i> positively correlated with total bilirubin (<i>r</i> = 0.455, <i>P</i> = 0.002) and direct bilirubin (<i>r</i> = 0.441, <i>P</i> = 0.003), whereas Î³-glutamyl transpeptidase was positively associated with <i>Parasutterella</i> (<i>r</i> = 0.466, <i>P</i> = 0.002) and negatively related to <i>Streptococcus</i> (<i>r</i> = -0.450, <i>P</i> = 0.003).

BCO1/BCO2 double knockout mice were initiated with a hepatic carcinogen (diethylnitrosamine) at 2 weeks of age. At 6 weeks of age, the mice were randomly assigned to an HFD (60% of energy as fat) with or without tomato powder (TP) feeding for 24 weeks. Results showed that TP feeding significantly decreased HCC development (67%, 83%, and 95% reduction in incidence, multiplicity, and tumor volume, respectively, <i>P</i> < 0.05). Protective effects of TP feeding were associated with (1) decreased hepatic inflammatory foci development and mRNA expression of proinflammatory biomarkers (IL1Î², IL6, IL12Î±, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and inducible NO synthase); (2) increased mRNA expression of deacetylase sirtuin 1 and nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase involving NAD<sup>+</sup> production; and (3) increased hepatic circadian clock genes (circadian locomotor output cycles kaput, period 2, and cryptochrome-2, Wee1). Furthermore, TP feeding increased gut microbial richness and diversity, and significantly decreased the relative abundance of the genus <i>Clostridium</i> and <i>Mucispirillum</i>, respectively.

At 40 days of age, duck serum and pectorals were collected for biochemical tests; liver and cecal contents of ducks were gathered for proteome and microbiota analysis, respectively. Serum MDA increased while pectorals T-AOC reduced linearly with enhancing stocking density. Duck lipid metabolism was altered under different stocking density as well. Serum LDL-C increased linearly with increasing stocking density. Proteome analysis revealed fatty acid biosynthesis proteins such as acyl-CoA synthetase family member 2 and fatty acid oxidation related proteins including acyl-CoA dehydrogenase long chain and acyl-coenzyme A oxidase were enriched in high stocking density group. Additionally, high stocking density increased oxidative response associated proteins such as DDRGK domain containing 1. Furthermore, increasing stocking density diminished proteins of anti-oxidant capacity including regucalcin and catalase. 16S rDNA analysis revealed that higher stocking density was accompanied with decreased microbial diversity, as well as depletion of anti-inflammatory bacterial taxa, including Bacteroidales, Butyricimonas and Alistipe. Besides, reduced bile acid metabolism-associated bacteria such as Ruminococcaceae, Clostridiales and Desulfovibrionaceae were found in the high-density group.

"The mammalian gut microbiome (GM) plays a critical role in xenobiotic biotransformation and can profoundly affect the toxic effects of xenobiotics. Previous in vitro studies have demonstrated that gut bacteria have the capability to metabolize arsenic (As); however, the specific roles of the gut microbiota in As metabolism in vivo and the toxic effects of As are largely unknown. Here, we administered sodium arsenite to conventionally raised mice (with normal microbiomes) and GM-disrupted mice with antibiotics to investigate the role of the gut microbiota in As biotransformation and its toxicity. We found that the urinary total As levels of GM-disrupted mice were much higher, but the fecal total As levels were lower, than the levels in the conventionally raised mice. In vitro experiments, in which the GM was incubated with As, also demonstrated that the gut bacteria could adsorb or take up As and thus reduce the free As levels in the culture medium. With the disruption of the gut microbiota, arsenic biotransformation was significantly perturbed. Of note, the urinary monomethylarsonic acid/dimethylarsinic acid ratio, a biomarker of arsenic metabolism and toxicity, was markedly increased. Meanwhile, the expression of genes of one-carbon metabolism, including folr2, bhmt, and mthfr, was downregulated, and the liver S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) levels were significantly decreased in the As-treated GM-disrupted mice only. Moreover, As exposure altered the expression of genes of the p53 signaling pathway, and the expression of multiple genes associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was also changed in the As-treated GM-disrupted mice only. Collectively, disruption of the GM enhances the effect of As on one-carbon metabolism, which could in turn affect As biotransformation. GM disruption also increases the toxic effects of As and may increase the risk of As-induced HCC in mice."

As fatty liver disease is a risk factor for development of hepatocellular carcinoma, we investigated the role of dietary fat type in tumor promotion by high-fat diets in mice after initiation with the chemical carcinogen diethyl nitrosamine. Tumor incidence and multiplicity were significantly greater in males than those in females. In males, fat type had complex effects on tumorigenesis. Preneoplastic foci were most prevalent in mice fed a polyunsaturated fat diet enriched in docosahexaenoic acid, whereas carcinomas and large visible liver tumors were significantly greater in mice fed a saturated fat diet made with cocoa butter relative to mice fed mono- or polyunsaturated fats. Different mechanisms thus seemed involved in early and late tumor promotion. The hepatic transcriptome and gut microbiome were assessed for traits associated with tumorigenesis. Hepatic expression of more than 20% of all genes was affected by sex, whereas fat type affected fewer genes. In males, the saturated fat diet induced expression of the proto-oncogene Agap2 and affected the expression of several cytochrome P450 genes, and genes involved in lipid, bile acid and fatty acid metabolism.

This altered microbiome along with small bowel bacterial overgrowth, through translocation across the gut, is associated with the development of decompensating complications. Studies have analyzed the correlation of certain bacterial families with the development of hepatic encephalopathy in cirrhotics. In general, stool and saliva dysbiosis with reduction of autochthonous bacteria in patients with cirrhosis incites changes in bacterial defenses and higher risk for bacterial infections, such as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and sepsis. Gut microbiome has even been associated with oncogenic pathways and under circumstances might promote the development of hepatocarcinogenesis. Lately, the existence of the oral-gut-liver axis has been related with the development of decompensating events. This link between the liver and the oral cavity could be <i>via</i> the gut through impaired intestinal permeability that allows direct translocation of bacteria from the oral cavity to the systemic circulation.

"Cirrhosis is a leading cause of death worldwide, yet there are no well-established risk stratifying tools for lethal complications, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Patients with liver cirrhosis undergo routine endoscopic surveillance, providing ready access to duodenal aspirate samples that could be a source for identifying novel biomarkers. The aim of this study was to characterize the microbiome and bile acid profiles in duodenal aspirates from patients with liver cirrhosis to assess the feasibility of developing biomarkers for HCC risk stratification. Thirty patients with liver cirrhosis were enrolled in the Microbiome, Microbial Markers, and Liver Disease study between May 2015 and March 2017. Detailed clinical and epidemiological data were collected at baseline and at 6-monthly follow-up visits. Duodenal aspirate fluid was collected at baseline for microbial characterization using 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing and bile acid quantification using mass spectroscopy. Alcohol-related cirrhosis was associated with reductions in the Bacteroidetes phylum, particularly Prevotella (13-fold reduction), and expansion of Staphylococcus (13-fold increase), compared to hepatitis C virus-related cirrhosis. Participants with hepatic encephalopathy (HE) had less microbial diversity compared to patients without HE (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05), and were characterized by expansion of Mycobacterium (45-fold increase) and Gram-positive cocci including Granulicatella (3.1-fold increase), unclassified Planococcaceae (3.3-fold increase), and unclassified Streptococcaceae (4.5-fold increase). Non-Hispanic White patients had reduced microbial richness (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.01) and diversity (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05), and increased levels of conjugated ursodeoxycholic acid (glycoursodeoxycholic acid and tauroursodeoxycholic acid, Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05) compared to Hispanic patients.

"Gut microbial dysbiosis is correlated with the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Therefore, analyzing the changing patterns in gut microbiota during HCC development, especially before HCC occurrence, is essential for the diagnosis and prevention of HCC based on gut microbial composition. However, these changing patterns in HCC are poorly understood, especially considering the sex differences in HCC incidence and mortality. Here, with an aim to determine the relationship between gut microbiota and HCC development in both sexes, and to screen potential microbial biomarkers for HCC diagnosis, we studied the changing patterns in the gut microbiota from mice of both sexes with liver-specific knockout of <i>Tsc1</i> (<i>LTsc1KO</i>) that spontaneously developed HCC by 9-10 months of age and compared them to the patterns observed in their wide-type <i>Tsc1<sup>fl/fl</sup></i> cohorts using high-throughput sequencing. Using the <i>LTsc1KO</i> model, we were able to successfully exclude the continuing influence of diet on the gut microbiota. Based on gut microbial composition, the female <i>LTsc1KO</i> mice exhibited gut microbial disorder earlier than male <i>LTsc1KO</i> mice during the development of HCC. Our findings also indicated that the decrease in the relative abundance of anaerobic bacteria and the increase in the relative abundance of facultative anaerobic bacteria can be used as risk indexes of female HCC, but would be invalid for male HCC. Most of the changes in the gut bacteria were different between female and male <i>LTsc1KO</i> mice. In particular, the increased abundances of <i>Allobaculum</i>, Erysipelotrichaceae, Neisseriaceae, <i>Sutterella</i>, Burkholderiales, and <i>Prevotella</i> species have potential for use as risk indicators of female HCC, and the increased abundances of Paraprevotella, Paraprevotellaceae, and <i>Prevotella</i> can probably be applied as risk indicators of male HCC. These relationships between the gut microbiota and HCC discovered in the present study may serve as a platform for the identification of potential targets for the diagnosis and prevention of HCC in the future."

However, decreased parenchymal portal venous flow after transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt insertion favours ischaemic liver injury which has been discussed to induce hepatocarcinogenesis causing hepatocellular cancer. This study aimed to explore the association between transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt placement and the development of hepatocellular cancer. A total of 1338 consecutive liver cirrhosis patients were included in this retrospective study between January 2004-December 2015.

Fecal samples from 166 CHC patients were compared with those from 23 healthy individuals; the gut microbiota community was analyzed using 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. CHC patients were diagnosed with persistently normal serum alanine aminotransferase without evidence of liver cirrhosis (LC) (PNALT, n = 18), chronic hepatitis (CH, n = 84), LC (n = 40), and hepatocellular carcinoma in LC (n = 24). Compared with healthy individuals, bacterial diversity was lower in persons with HCV infection, with a decrease in the order Clostridiales and an increase in Streptococcus and Lactobacillus. Microbiota dysbiosis already appeared in the PNALT stage with the transient increase in Bacteroides and Enterobacteriaceae. Predicted metagenomics of microbial communities showed an increase in the urease gene mainly encoded by viridans streptococci during CHC progression, consistent with a significantly higher fecal pH in CH and LC patients than in healthy individuals or those in the PNALT stage. HCV infection is associated with gut dysbiosis, even in patients with mild liver disease. Additionally, overgrowth of viridans streptococci can account for hyperammonemia in CH and LC.

Shenling Baizhu powder (SLBZP), a formulation of a variety of natural medicinal plants, has hepatoprotective properties and clinical efficacy in treating non-infectious intestinal disease. SLBZP has improved NAFLD symptoms; however, its mechanism of action is unknown. We established an NAFLD model in rats given a high-fat diet (HFD), administered different interventions and measured serum biochemical indices and inflammatory factors. Liver tissues were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and oil red O, and colon tissues were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. The expression profiles of liver TLR4 pathway related protein was confirmed by western blotting. Changes in intestinal microbiota composition were analyzed using a 16S rDNA sequencing technique. Of note, SLBZP effectively reduced body weight in HFD-fed rats (pâ€¯<â€¯0.05). Serum biochemical analysis indicated that SLBZP decreased the serum level of total cholesterol (TC) and improved liver function. Additionally, SLBZP decreased the serum level of endotoxin, tumor necrosis factor Î± (TNF-Î±), interleukin-1Î² (IL-Î²) (pâ€¯<â€¯0.05), and decreased the expression of TLR4 pathway related protein. Pathological examination showed that SLBZP alleviates hepatic steatosis and repairs colon mucosa. Microbiome analysis revealed that SLBZP improved the abundance of intestinal microbiota. In taxonomy-based analysis, compared with control rats, SLBZP-treated rats showed obvious changes in intestinal microbiota composition. Moreover, SLBZP increased the relative abundance of short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria, including Bifidobacterium and Anaerostipes. Taken together, these results suggest that the effects of SLBZP against NAFLD may be related to the increased abundance of beneficial gut microbiota and decreased levels of LPS in the portal vein."

However, the link between gut microbiota and hepatocarcinogenesis remains to be clarified. The aim of this study was to explore what features of the gut microbiota are associated with HCC in patients with cirrhosis and NAFLD. A consecutive series of patients with NAFLD-related cirrhosis and HCC (group 1, 21 patients), NAFLD-related cirrhosis without HCC (group 2, 20 patients), and healthy controls (group 3, 20 patients) was studied for gut microbiota profile, intestinal permeability, inflammatory status, and circulating mononuclear cells. We finally constructed a model depicting the most relevant correlations among these features, possibly involved in hepatocarcinogenesis. Patients with HCC showed increased levels of fecal calprotectin, while intestinal permeability was similar to patients with cirrhosis but without HCC. Plasma levels of interleukin 8 (IL8), IL13, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand (CCL) 3, CCL4, and CCL5 were higher in the HCC group and associated with an activated status of circulating monocytes. The fecal microbiota of the whole group of patients with cirrhosis showed higher abundance of Enterobacteriaceae and Streptococcus and a reduction in Akkermansia. Bacteroides and Ruminococcaceae were increased in the HCC group, while Bifidobacterium was reduced. Akkermansia and Bifidobacterium were inversely correlated with calprotectin concentration, which in turn was associated with humoral and cellular inflammatory markers. A similar behavior was also observed for Bacteroides. Conclusion: Our results suggest that in patients with cirrhosis and NAFLD the gut microbiota profile and systemic inflammation are significantly correlated and can concur in the process of hepatocarcinogenesis."

Using this diet, we comprehensively analyzed changes in the gut microbiota and its metabolic functions during the development of HCC in NASH. Mice fed the STHD-01 developed NASH within 9 weeks. NASH further progressed into HCC by 41 weeks. Treatment with antibiotics significantly attenuated liver pathology and suppressed tumor development, indicating the critical role of the gut microbiota in tumor development in this model. Accumulation of cholesterol and bile acids in the liver and feces increased after feeding the mice with STHD-01. Treatment with antibiotics did not reverse these phenotypes. In contrast, accumulation of secondary bile acids was dramatically reduced after the treatment with antibiotics, suggesting the critical role of the gut microbiota in the conversion of primary bile acids to secondary bile acids. Secondary bile acids such as deoxycholic acid activated the mTOR, pathway in hepatocytes. Activation of mTOR was observed in the liver of mice fed STHD-01, and the activation was reduced when mice were treated with antibiotics.

Here, we show that proton pump inhibitors promote progression of alcoholic liver disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis in mice by increasing numbers of intestinal Enterococcus spp. Translocating enterococci lead to hepatic inflammation and hepatocyte death. Expansion of intestinal Enterococcus faecalis is sufficient to exacerbate ethanol-induced liver disease in mice. Proton pump inhibitor use increases the risk of developing alcoholic liver disease among alcohol-dependent patients. Reduction of gastric acid secretion therefore appears to promote overgrowth of intestinal Enterococcus, which promotes liver disease, based on data from mouse models and humans. Recent increases in the use of gastric acid-suppressive medications might contribute to the increasing incidence of chronic liver disease.Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) reduce gastric acid secretion and modulate gut microbiota composition.

"Recent technological advancements including metagenomics sequencing and metabolomics have allowed the discovery of critical functions of gut microbiota in obesity, malnutrition, neurological disorders, asthma, and xenobiotic metabolism. Classification of the human gut microbiome into distinct ""enterotypes"" has been proposed to serve as a new paradigm for understanding the interplay between microbial variation and human disease phenotypes, as many organs are affected by gut microbiota modifications during the pathogenesis of diseases. Gut microbiota remotely interacts with liver and other metabolic organs of the host through various microbial metabolites that are absorbed into the systemic circulation. The present review summarizes recent literature regarding the importance of gut microbiota in modulating the physiological and pathological responses of various host organs, and describes the functions of the known microbial metabolites that are involved in this remote sensing process, with a primary focus on the gut microbiota-liver axis. Under physiological conditions, gut microbiota modulates the hepatic transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome, most notably down-regulating cytochrome P450 3a mediated xenobiotic metabolism. Gut microbiome also modulates the rhythmicity in liver gene expression, likely through microbial metabolites, such as butyrate and propionate that serve as epigenetic modifiers. Additionally, the production of host hormones such as primary bile acids and glucagon like peptide 1 is altered by gut microbiota to modify intermediary metabolism of the host. Dysregulation of gut microbiota is implicated in various liver diseases such as alcoholic liver disease, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, liver cirrhosis, cholangitis, and liver cancer. Gut microbiota modifiers such as probiotics and prebiotics are increasingly recognized as novel therapeutic modalities for liver and other types of human diseases."

The objective of this study was to establish the relationship between butyrate and dysregulated BA synthesis-induced hepatitis as well as the effect of butyrate in reversing the liver pathology. Wild-type (WT) and FXR knockout (KO) male mice were placed on a control (CD) or western diet (WD) for 15 months. In the presence or absence of butyrate supplementation, feces obtained from 15-month-old WD-fed FXR KO mice, which had severe hepatitis and liver tumors, were transplanted to 7-month-old WD-fed FXR KO for 3 months. Hepatic phenotypes, microbiota profile, and BA composition were analyzed. Butyrate-generating bacteria and colonic butyrate concentration were reduced due to FXR inactivation and further reduced by WD intake. In addition, WD-fed FXR KO male mice had the highest concentration of hepatic Î²-muricholic acid (Î²-MCA) and bacteria-generated deoxycholic acid (DCA) accompanied by serious hepatitis. Moreover, dysregulated BA and reduced SCFA signaling co-existed in both human liver cancers and WD-fed FXR KO mice. Microbiota transplantation using butyrate-deficient feces derived from 15-month-old WD-fed FXR KO mice increased hepatic lymphocyte numbers as well as hepatic Î²-MCA and DCA concentrations. Furthermore, butyrate supplementation reduced hepatic Î²-MCA as well as DCA and eliminated hepatic lymphocyte infiltration. In conclusion, reduced butyrate contributes to the development of hepatitis in the FXR KO mouse model. In addition, butyrate reverses dysregulated BA synthesis and its associated hepatitis.

In this study, we analyze epidemiological, clinical, microbiological and laboratory data from patients with r-CDI, relapse, and reinfection-CDI over 5 years and compared with a control group (non r-CDI). Among 60 patients with r-CDI, 36 patients had stool samples collected from two or more episodes, which were molecularly analyzed. Based on ribotyping, 63.9% of the samples were relapse, and 36.1% reinfection. In a multivariable logistic regression analysis, previous antibiotic exposure was found to be a risk factor for r-CDI (OR: 2.23; 95% CI: 1.0-4.9; pÂ =Â 0.04). Patients with relapse had previous antibiotic exposure more frequently than did patients with reinfection (pÂ =Â 0.03), and patients with reinfection suffered more frequently from chronic liver disease (pÂ =Â 0.02) than did relapse patients. Relapse patients compared with the control group had a higher percentage of previous antibiotic exposure, although the difference was statistically no significant (73.9% vs. 91.3 pÂ =Â 0.06). No significant differences for the selected variables were observed between the reinfection and control groups, although we observed a higher percentage of patients with chronic liver disease (30.8% vs 13.3%; pÂ =Â 0.08).

Defining the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of NAFLD has been hampered by a lack of animal models that closely recapitulate the severe end of the disease spectrum in humans, including bridging hepatic fibrosis. Here we demonstrate that a novel experimental model employing thermoneutral housing, as opposed to standard housing, resulted in lower stress-driven production of corticosterone, augmented mouse proinflammatory immune responses and markedly exacerbated high-fat diet (HFD)-induced NAFLD pathogenesis. Disease exacerbation at thermoneutrality was conserved across multiple mouse strains and was associated with augmented intestinal permeability, an altered microbiome and activation of inflammatory pathways that are associated with the disease in humans. Depletion of Gram-negative microbiota, hematopoietic cell deletion of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and inactivation of the IL-17 axis resulted in altered immune responsiveness and protection from thermoneutral-housing-driven NAFLD amplification. Finally, female mice, typically resistant to HFD-induced obesity and NAFLD, develop full disease characteristics at thermoneutrality.

LTA enhances the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) of hepatic stellate cells (HSC) collaboratively with an obesity-induced gut microbial metabolite, deoxycholic acid, to upregulate the expression of SASP factors and COX2 through Toll-like receptor 2. Interestingly, COX2-mediated prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> (PGE<sub>2</sub>) production suppresses the antitumor immunity through a PTGER4 receptor, thereby contributing to HCC progression.

"Sleep disturbances are common in patients with cirrhosis, but their determinants and effects on health-related quality of life are not well-understood. We investigated the prevalence of disturbed sleep in these patients, factors associated with sleep disruption, and effects on quality of life. We performed a prospective, cross-sectional study of 193 stable ambulatory patients with cirrhosis (154 with decompensated cirrhosis). Participants completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (to assess sleep quality), the Chronic Liver Disease Questionnaire (CLDQ), and muscle cramp questionnaires and underwent neurocognitive testing. Actigraphy was performed in a subset of patients with normal and disturbed sleep. We collected serum samples from subjects with normal and disturbed sleep and performed non-targeted metabolomic analyses. Of the study subjects, 157 (81%) had disturbed sleep, with Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index scores >5. Disturbed sleep was associated with muscle cramps, daytime somnolence, and decreased quality of life on the basis of CLDQ scores. Factors independently associated with disturbed sleep in logistic regression analysis included hypoalbuminemia, opiate therapy, and muscle cramps. Disturbed sleep was independently associated with CLDQ score (correlation parameter, -36.6; 95% confidence interval, -24 to -49; P < .001) on linear regression. Disturbed sleep was associated with neurocognitive impairment and with significantly delayed bedtime and decreased total sleep time, measured by actigraphy. Disturbed sleep was associated with metabolome signatures of alterations to the intestinal microbiome and lipid, arginine, and urea cycle metabolism. Most patients with advanced cirrhosis (81%) have disturbed sleep. This has negative effects on quality of life and is associated with disruptions of several metabolic pathways, including metabolism by the intestinal microbiota."

"Non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFLD) is a common, multi-factorial, and poorly understood liver disease whose incidence is globally rising. NAFLD is generally asymptomatic and associated with other manifestations of the metabolic syndrome. Yet, up to 25% of NAFLD patients develop a progressive inflammatory liver disease termed non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) that may progress towards cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and the need for liver transplantation. In recent years, several lines of evidence suggest that the gut microbiome represents a significant environmental factor contributing to NAFLD development and its progression into NASH. Suggested microbiome-associated mechanisms contributing to NAFLD and NASH include dysbiosis-induced deregulation of the gut endothelial barrier function, which facilitates systemic bacterial translocation, and intestinal and hepatic inflammation. Furthermore, increased microbiome-modulated metabolites such as lipopolysaccharides, short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), bile acids, and ethanol, may affect liver pathology through multiple direct and indirect mechanisms. Herein, we discuss the associations, mechanisms, and clinical implications of the microbiome's contribution to NAFLD and NASH. Understanding these contributions to the development of fatty liver pathogenesis and its clinical course may serve as a basis for development of therapeutic microbiome-targeting approaches for treatment and prevention of NAFLD and NASH. Intestinal host-microbiome interactions play diverse roles in the pathogenesis and progression of NAFLD and NASH. Elucidation of the mechanisms driving these microbial effects on the pathogenesis of NAFLD and NASH may enable to identify new diagnostic and therapeutic targets of these common metabolic liver diseases. This article is part of a special issue on microbiota."	"[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'})]"	27617201	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE

"Changes within the gut microbiota contribute to the progression of chronic liver diseases. According to the results of several studies performed in animal models, gut dysbiosis plays an important role in hepatocarcinogenesis. The aim of this study was to explore the characteristics of gut microbiota associated with the presence of hepatocellular cancer (HCC) in patients with cirrhosis of the liver undergoing liver transplantation. A total of 15 patients with HCC and 15 non-HCC patients matched according to etiology of cirrhosis and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) scores who underwent liver transplantations between 2012 and 2014 were included. Analysis of their gut microbial profile was based on prospectively collected stool samples from the pretransplant period. Patients with and without HCC were similar with respect to age (PÂ = .506), sex (PÂ = .700), hepatitis C virus (PÂ > .999) and hepatitis B virus (PÂ = .715) infection status, alcoholic liver disease (PÂ > .999), and MELD score (PÂ = .337). Notably, the presence of HCC was associated with significantly increased fecal counts of Escherichia coli (PÂ = .025). Prediction of HCC presence based on E coli counts was associated with the area under the receiver-operating curve of 0.742 (95% confidence interval, 0.564-0.920), with the optimal cutoff on the level of 17.728 (natural logarithm of colony-forming units per 1Â g of feces). Sensitivity and specificity rates for the established cutoff were 66.7% and 73.3%, respectively. The profile of gut microbiota associated with the presence of HCC in cirrhotic patients is characterized by increased fecal counts of E coli. Therefore, intestinal overgrowth of E coli may contribute to the process of hepatocarcinogenesis."	"[StringElement('Journal Article', attributes={'UI': 'D016428'})]"	27496472	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE

The importance of gut-liver-adipose tissue axis has become evident and treatments targeting gut microbiota may improve inflammatory and metabolic parameters in NASH patients. In a randomized, controlled clinical trial, involving 50 biopsy-proven NASH patients, we investigated the effects of synbiotic supplementation on metabolic parameters, hepatic steatosis, intestinal permeability, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) serum levels. Patients were separated into two groups receiving Lactobacillus reuteri with guar gum and inulin for three months and healthy balanced nutritional counseling versus nutritional counseling alone. Before and after the intervention we assessed steatosis by magnetic resonance imaging, intestinal permeability by lactulose/mannitol urinary excretion and SIBO by glucose breath testing. NASH patients presented high gut permeability, but low prevalence of SIBO. After the intervention, only the synbiotic group presented a reduction in steatosis, lost weight, diminished BMI and waist circumference measurement. Synbiotic did not improve intestinal permeability or LPS levels. We concluded that synbiotic supplementation associated with nutritional counseling seems superior to nutritional counseling alone for NASH treatment as it attenuates steatosis and may help to achieve weight loss."

Additionally chronic HFD-fed mice spontaneously developed liver tumors with significantly increased hepatic BA levels. Enhancing intestinal excretion of hydrophobic BAs in the NASH-HCC model mice by a 2% cholestyramine feeding significantly prevented HCC development. The gut microbiota alterations were closely correlated with altered BA levels in liver and feces. HFD-induced inflammation inhibited key BA transporters, resulting in sustained increases in intrahepatic BA concentrations.

At baseline and after a 3-week HHD (Eurodiets(Â®), ~1000Â kcal/day, ~125Â g protein/day), we measured gut microbiota composition and function by shotgun metagenomics; body weight; body composition by bioelectrical impedance analysis; liver and visceral fat by magnetic resonance imaging; plasma C-reactive protein (CRP); and liver tests. Results between both time points, expressed as median (first and third quartile), were compared by Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. At baseline, age was 50 (47-55) years and body mass index 34.6 (32.4, 36.7) kg/m(2). HDD decreased body weight by 3.6Â % (pÂ <Â 0.001), percent liver fat by 65Â % (pÂ <Â 0.001), and CRP by 19Â % (pÂ =Â 0.014).

"The liver receives blood from the gastrointestinal tract through the portal vein, and thereby is exposed continuously to dietary antigens and commensal bacteria. Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is associated with intestinal dysbiosis, increased intestinal permeability, release of microbes into the portal circulation, and increased serum levels and liver deposits of IgA. We characterized B-cell production of IgA in livers of mice at homeostasis, after oral immunization, in a mouse model of ALD and in human liver samples. We performed studies with Balb/c and C57BL/6-Ly5.1 mice, as well as transgenic mice (quasimonoclonal, activation-induced [cytidine] deaminase-Cre-tamoxifen-dependent estrogen receptor 2 [ERT2], Blimp-1-green fluorescent protein [GFP]). C57BL/6-Ly5.1 mice were fed chronic plus binge ethanol to create a model of ALD. Some mice also were given repeated injections of FTY720, which prevents egress of IgA-secreting cells from Peyer's patches. We obtained nontumor liver tissues from patients with colorectal carcinoma undergoing surgery for liver metastases or hepatocellular carcinoma. B cells were isolated from mouse and human liver tissues and analyzed by flow cytometry and enzyme-linked ImmunoSpot (ELISpot). In wild-type and transgenic mice, we traced newly generated IgA-secreting cells at steady state and after oral immunization with 4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenylacetyl (NP)-Ficoll or cholera toxin. IgA responses were also evaluated in our model of ALD. Livers of control mice contained proliferative plasmablasts that originated from Peyer's patches and produced IgAs reactive to commensal bacteria. After oral immunization with cholera toxin or a thymus-independent antigen, a substantial number of antigen-specific IgA-secreting cells was found in the liver. Mice fed ethanol had features of hepatitis and increased numbers of IgA-secreting cells in liver, compared with mice given control diets, as well as higher levels of serum IgA and IgA deposits in liver sinusoids. Injection of FTY720 during ethanol feeding reduced liver and serum levels of IgA and IgA deposits in liver and prevented liver injury. Human liver tissues contained a significant proportion of IgA-producing plasma cells that shared phenotypic and functional attributes with those from mouse liver, including reactivity to commensal bacteria. Based on studies of mice and human liver tissues, we found the liver to be a site of IgA production by B cells, derived from gut-associated lymphoid tissues. These IgAs react with commensal bacteria and oral antigens. Livers from mice with ethanol-induced injury contain increased numbers of IgA-secreting cells and have IgA deposits in sinusoids. IgAs in the liver could mediate clearance of gut-derived antigens that arrive through portal circulation at homeostasis and protect these organs from pathogens."

Epidemiological studies have demonstrated consumption of fish oil or perilla oil rich in n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) protects against NAFLD. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In the present study, we adopted 16s rRNA amplicon sequencing technique to investigate the impacts of fish oil and perilla oil on gut microbiomes modification in rats with high-fat diet- (HFD-) induced NAFLD. Both fish oil and perilla oil ameliorated HFD-induced hepatic steatosis and inflammation. In comparison with the low-fat control diet, HFD feeding significantly reduced the relative abundance of Gram-positive bacteria in the gut, which was slightly reversed by either fish oil or perilla oil. Additionally, fish oil and perilla oil consumption abrogated the elevated abundance of Prevotella and Escherichia in the gut from HFD fed animals. Interestingly, the relative abundance of antiobese Akkermansia was remarkably increased only in animals fed fish oil compared with HFD group. In conclusion, compared with fish oil, perilla oil has similar but slightly weaker potency against HFD-induced NAFLD and gut dysbiosis."

We aimed to study the gut microbial changes over liver disease progression using a streptozotocin-high fat diet (STZ-HFD) induced NASH-HCC C57BL/6J mouse model that is highly relevant to human liver disease. The fecal microbiota at various liver pathological stages was analyzed by 16S rDNA gene pyrosequencing. Both UniFrac analysis and partial least squares-discriminant analysis showed significant structural alterations in gut microbiota during the development of liver disease. Co-abundance network analysis highlighted relationships between genera. Spearman correlation analysis revealed that the bacterial species, Atopobium spp., Bacteroides spp., Bacteroides vulgatus, Bacteroides acidifaciens, Bacteroides uniformis, Clostridium cocleatum, Clostridium xylanolyticum and Desulfovibrio spp., markedly increased in model mice, were positively correlated with LPS levels and pathophysiological features.

"The beneficial roles of probiotics in lowering the gastrointestinal inflammation and preventing colorectal cancer have been frequently demonstrated, but their immunomodulatory effects and mechanism in suppressing the growth of extraintestinal tumors remain unexplored. Here, we adopted a mouse model and metagenome sequencing to investigate the efficacy of probiotic feeding in controlling s.c. hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and the underlying mechanism suppressing the tumor progression. Our result demonstrated that Prohep, a novel probiotic mixture, slows down the tumor growth significantly and reduces the tumor size and weight by 40% compared with the control. From a mechanistic point of view the down-regulated IL-17 cytokine and its major producer Th17 cells, whose levels decreased drastically, played critical roles in tumor reduction upon probiotics feeding. Cell staining illustrated that the reduced Th17 cells in the tumor of the probiotic-treated group is mainly caused by the reduced frequency of migratory Th17 cells from the intestine and peripheral blood. In addition, shotgun-metagenome sequencing revealed the crosstalk between gut microbial metabolites and the HCC development. Probiotics shifted the gut microbial community toward certain beneficial bacteria, including Prevotella and Oscillibacter, that are known producers of antiinflammatory metabolites, which subsequently reduced the Th17 polarization and promoted the differentiation of antiinflammatory Treg/Tr1 cells in the gut. Overall, our study offers novel insights into the mechanism by which probiotic treatment modulates the microbiota and influences the regulation of the T-cell differentiation in the gut, which in turn alters the level of the proinflammatory cytokines in the extraintestinal tumor microenvironment."

"Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) patients progress to liver cirrhosis and even hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Several lines of evidence indicate that accumulation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and disruption of gut microbiota play contributory roles in HCC. Moreover, in a dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis model in mice, a high-fat diet increases portal LPS level and promotes hepatic inflammation and fibrosis. However, this diet-induced NASH model requires at least 50 weeks for carcinogenesis. In this study, we sought to determine whether increased intestinal permeability would aggravate liver inflammation and fibrosis and accelerate tumorigenesis in a diet-induced NASH model. Mice were fed a choline-deficient high-fat (CDHF) diet for 4 or 12 weeks. The DSS group was fed CDHF and intermittently received 1% DSS in the drinking water. Exposure to DSS promoted mucosal changes such as crypt loss and increased the number of inflammatory cells in the colon. In the DSS group, portal LPS levels were elevated at 4 weeks, and the proportions of Clostridium cluster XI in the fecal microbiota were elevated. In addition, levels of serum transaminase, number of lobular inflammatory cells, F4/80 staining-positive area, and levels of inflammatory cytokines were all elevated in the DSS group. Liver histology in the DSS group revealed severe fibrosis at 12 weeks. Liver tumors were detected in the DSS group at 12 weeks, but not in the other groups. Thus, DSS administration promoted liver tumors in a CDHF diet-induced NASH mouse over the short term, suggesting that the induction of intestinal inflammation and gut disruption of microbiota in NASH promote hepatic tumorigenesis."

HBV infection resulted in an increase in potential H2S- and CH3SH-producing phylotypes such as Fusobacterium, Filifactor, Eubacterium, Parvimonas and Treponema, which might contribute to the increased oral malodor. These key oral-derived phylotypes might invade into the gut as opportunistic pathogens and contribute to altering the composition of the gut microbiota. This study provided important clues that dysbiosis of the oral microbiota might be involved in the development of HBV-CLD. Greater understanding of the relationships between the dysbiosis of oral microbiota and the development of HBV-CLD might facilitate the development of non-invasive differential diagnostic procedures and targeted treatments of HBV-CLD patients harbouring specific oral phylotypes."

"The intestinal lumen is a host place for a wide range of microbiota and sets a unique interplay between local immune system, inflammatory cells and intestinal epithelium, forming a physical barrier against microbial invaders and toxins. Bacterial translocation is the migration of viable or nonviable microorganisms or their pathogen-associated molecular patterns, such as lipopolysaccharide, from the gut lumen to the mesenteric lymph nodes, systemic circulation and other normally sterile extraintestinal sites. A series of studies have shown that translocation of bacteria and their products across the intestinal barrier is a commonplace in patients with liver disease. The deterioration of intestinal barrier integrity and the consulting increased intestinal permeability in cirrhotic patients play a pivotal pathophysiological role in the development of severe complications as high rate of infections, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, hepatic encephalopathy, hepatorenal syndrome, variceal bleeding, progression of liver injury and hepatocellular carcinoma. Nevertheless, the exact cellular and molecular mechanisms implicated in the phenomenon of microbial translocation in liver cirrhosis have not been fully elucidated yet."

"Patients with systemic inflammatory diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, chronic liver disease) commonly develop debilitating symptoms (i.e., sickness behaviors) that arise from changes in brain function. The microbiota-gut-brain axis alters brain function and probiotic ingestion can influence behavior. However, how probiotics do this remains unclear. We have previously described a novel periphery-to-brain communication pathway in the setting of peripheral organ inflammation whereby monocytes are recruited to the brain in response to systemic TNF-Î± signaling, leading to microglial activation and subsequently driving sickness behavior development. Therefore, we investigated whether probiotic ingestion (i.e., probiotic mixture VSL#3) alters this periphery-to-brain communication pathway, thereby reducing subsequent sickness behavior development. Using a well characterized mouse model of liver inflammation, we now show that probiotic (VSL#3) treatment attenuates sickness behavior development in mice with liver inflammation without affecting disease severity, gut microbiota composition, or gut permeability. Attenuation of sickness behavior development was associated with reductions in microglial activation and cerebral monocyte infiltration. These events were paralleled by changes in markers of systemic immune activation, including decreased circulating TNF-Î± levels. Our observations highlight a novel pathway through which probiotics mediate cerebral changes and alter behavior. These findings allow for the potential development of novel therapeutic interventions targeted at the gut microbiome to treat inflammation-associated sickness behaviors in patients with systemic inflammatory diseases. This research shows that probiotics, when eaten, can improve the abnormal behaviors (including social withdrawal and immobility) that are commonly associated with inflammation. Probiotics are able to cause this effect within the body by changing how the immune system signals the brain to alter brain function. These findings broaden our understanding of how probiotics may beneficially affect brain function in the context of inflammation occurring within the body and may open potential new therapeutic alternatives for the treatment of these alterations in behavior that can greatly affect patient quality of life."

"Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) is the commonest cause of chronic liver disease in the western world. Current diagnostic methods including Fibroscan have limitations, thus there is a need for more robust non-invasive screening methods. The gut microbiome is altered in several gastrointestinal and hepatic disorders resulting in altered, unique gut fermentation patterns, detectable by analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in urine, breath and faeces. We performed a proof of principle pilot study to determine if progressive fatty liver disease produced an altered urinary VOC pattern; specifically NAFLD and Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH). 34 patients were recruited: 8 NASH cirrhotics (NASH-C); 7 non-cirrhotic NASH; 4 NAFLD and 15 controls. Urine was collected and stored frozen. For assay, the samples were defrosted and aliquoted into vials, which were heated to 40Â±0.1Â°C and the headspace analyzed by FAIMS (Field Asymmetric Ion Mobility Spectroscopy). A previously used data processing pipeline employing a Random Forrest classification algorithm and using a 10 fold cross validation method was applied. Urinary VOC results demonstrated sensitivity of 0.58 (0.33 - 0.88), but specificity of 0.93 (0.68 - 1.00) and an Area Under Curve (AUC) 0.73 (0.55 - 0.90) to distinguish between liver disease and controls. However, NASH/NASH-C was separated from the NAFLD/controls with a sensitivity of 0.73 (0.45 - 0.92), specificity of 0.79 (0.54 - 0.94) and AUC of 0.79 (0.64 - 0.95), respectively.

Mice pretreated with 7,12-dimethylbenz (a) anthracene were divided into three feeding groups: normal diet (Control), high-starch diet (Starch), and high-fat diet (HFD) groups. In addition, an STZ group containing mice that were fed a normal diet and injected with streptozotosin to induce hyperglycemia was included. The STZ group demonstrated severe hyperglycemia, whereas the Starch group demonstrated mild hyperglycemia and insulin resistance. The HFD group demonstrated mild hyperglycemia and severe insulin resistance. Multiple HCC were macroscopically and histologically observed only in the HFD group. Hepatic steatosis was observed in the Starch and HFD groups, but levels of inflammatory cytokines, interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor-Î±, and IL-1Î², were elevated only in the HFD group. The composition of gut microbiota was similar between the Control and STZ groups. A significantly higher number of Clostridium cluster XI was detected in the feces of the HFD group than that of all other groups; it was not detectable in the Starch group. These data suggested that hyperglycemia had no effect on hepatic carcinogenesis. Different incidences of HCC between the Starch and HFD groups may be attributable to degree of insulin resistance, but diet-induced changes in gut microbiota including Clostridium cluster XI may have influenced hepatic carcinogenesis. In conclusion, in addition to the normalization of blood glucose levels, diabetics may need to control insulin resistance and diet contents to prevent HCC development."

"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease represents the most common chronic liver disease in obese children of industrialized countries. Nowadays the first line of treatment of pediatric non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is based on dietary and lifestyle intervention; however compliance to these interventions is very difficult to maintain in long term period. This editorial discusses about docosahexaenoic acid treatment as possible novel approach for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in obese children. Docosahexaenoic acid may modulate the inflammatory response, improve insulin sensitivity and could be effective in enhancing intestinal barrier integrity, essential to protect a healthy gut-liver axis. Indeed alteration of gut microbiota composition and increased intestinal permeability may rise the exposure of liver to gut-derived bacterial products, causing activation of signalling pathways implicated in liver inflammation and fibrogenesis. This mechanism has been observed in vitro and animal models of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease but also in a clinical study in adults. While evidence suggests that n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids supplementation may decrease liver fat in adults, in pediatric population only a study examined this topic. In obese children with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease well designed randomized controlled trials are needed to better clarify the possible efficacy of docosahexaenoic acid treatment, and underlying mechanisms, to identify the optimal required dose and to evaluate if the docosahexaenoic acid effect is limited to the duration of the treatment or it may continue after the end of treatment."

This study was carried out to investigate the efficacy of probiotic therapy in alleviating small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) and permeability in chronic liver disease. Fifty-three patients with chronic liver disease were randomized to either probiotic therapy or placebo. Six bacterial species were used: Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium lactis, Bifidobacterium longum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, and Streptococcus thermophilus. After 4 weeks, changes in the composition of fecal bacteria, SIBO, intestinal permeability, and clinical symptoms were examined. Three of the six probiotic species, B. lactis, L. rhamnosus, and L. acidophilus, increased in the feces of the probiotic therapy group (P<0.001), whereas there was no change in fecal microbiota in the placebo group. SIBO disappeared in many individuals of the probiotic therapy group, but none in the placebo (24 vs. 0%, P<0.05). General gastrointestinal symptoms also improved more in the probiotic group and improvement in intestinal permeability was slightly but not significantly more frequent in the probiotic arm than the placebo arm (50 vs. 31.3%, P=0.248). Numbers of lactobacilli in stool were correlated negatively with intestinal permeability (P for trend<0.05). Liver chemistry did not improve significantly in either group.

"Whereas a significant role for intestinal microbiota in affecting the pathogenesis and progression of chronic hepatic diseases is well documented, the contribution of the intestinal flora to acute liver injury has not been extensively addressed. Elucidating the influence of the intestinal microbiota on acute liver inflammation would be important for better understanding the transition from acute injury to chronic liver disease. Using the Concanavalin A (ConA)-induced liver injury model in laboratory mice, we show that the severity of acute hepatic damage varies greatly among genetically identical mice raised in different environments and harboring distinct microbiota. Through reconstitution of germ-free (GF) mice, and the co-housing of conventional mice, we provide direct evidence that manipulation of the intestinal flora alters susceptibility to ConA-induced liver injury. Through deep sequencing of the fecal microbiome, we observe that the relative abundance of Ruminococcaceae, a Gram(+) family within the class Clostridia, but distinct from segmented filamentous bacteria, is positively associated with the degree of liver damage. Searching for the underlying mechanism(s) that regulate susceptibility to ConA, we provide evidence that the extent of liver injury following triggering of the death receptor Fas varies greatly as a function of the microbiota. We demonstrate that the extent of Fas-induced liver injury increases in GF mice after microbiota reconstitution, and decreases in conventionally raised mice following reduction in intestinal bacterial load, by antibiotic treatment. We also show that the regulation of sensitivity to Fas-induced liver injury is dependent upon the toll-like receptor signaling molecule MyD88. In conclusion, the status and composition of the intestinal microbiota determine the susceptibility to ConA-induced acute liver injury.

The most common mechanism for the development of NAFLD is insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is commonly associated with obesity, although it can develop in individuals who do not have obesity. A consequence of insulin resistance is increased peripheral lipolysis and increased delivery of free fatty acids to the liver.

While much work has been done mainly in cell culture models, the free fatty acid concentration in the liver is not significantly changed in NAFLD.

"Hepatocellular carcinoma is the main liver-related cause of death in patients with compensated cirrhosis. The early phases are asymptomatic and the prognosis is poor, which makes prevention essential. We propose that non-selective beta-blockers decrease the incidence and growth of hepatocellular carcinoma via a reduction of the inflammatory load from the gut to the liver and inhibition of angiogenesis. Due to their effect on the portal pressure, non-selective beta-blockers are used for prevention of esophageal variceal bleeding. Recently, non-hemodynamic effects of beta-blockers have received increasing attention. Blockage of Î²-adrenoceptors in the intestinal mucosa and gut lymphatic tissue together with changes in type and virulence of the intestinal microbiota lead to reduced bacterial translocation and a subsequent decrease in the portal load of pathogen-associated molecular patterns. This may reduce hepatic inflammation. Blockage of Î²-adrenoceptors also decrease angiogenesis by inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factors. Because gut-derived inflammation and neo-angiogenesis are important in hepatic carcinogenesis, non-selective beta-blockers can potentially reduce the development and growth of hepatocellular carcinoma. Rodent and in vitro studies support the hypothesis, but clinical verification is needed. Different study designs may be considered. The feasibility of a randomized controlled trial is limited due to the necessary large number of patients and long follow-up. Observational studies carry a high risk of bias.

"Obesity has become more prevalent in most developed countries over the past few decades, and is increasingly recognized as a major risk factor for several common types of cancer. As the worldwide obesity epidemic has shown no signs of abating, better understanding of the mechanisms underlying obesity-associated cancer is urgently needed. Although several events were proposed to be involved in obesity-associated cancer, the exact molecular mechanisms that integrate these events have remained largely unclear. Here we show that senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) has crucial roles in promoting obesity-associated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development in mice. Dietary or genetic obesity induces alterations of gut microbiota, thereby increasing the levels of deoxycholic acid (DCA), a gut bacterial metabolite known to cause DNA damage. The enterohepatic circulation of DCA provokes SASP phenotype in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), which in turn secretes various inflammatory and tumour-promoting factors in the liver, thus facilitating HCC development in mice after exposure to chemical carcinogen. Notably, blocking DCA production or reducing gut bacteria efficiently prevents HCC development in obese mice. Similar results were also observed in mice lacking an SASP inducer or depleted of senescent HSCs, indicating that the DCA-SASP axis in HSCs has key roles in obesity-associated HCC development. Moreover, signs of SASP were also observed in the HSCs in the area of HCC arising in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, indicating that a similar pathway may contribute to at least certain aspects of obesity-associated HCC development in humans as well.

"Due to its anatomic connection, the liver is constantly exposed to gut-derived bacterial products or metabolites. Disruption of gut homeostasis is associated with many human diseases. The aim of this study was to determine the role of gut homeostasis in initiation and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Disruption of intestinal homeostasis by penicillin or dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) and its restoration by probiotics were applied in a diethylnitrosamine (DEN) model of rat hepatocarcinogenesis. Patients with liver cirrhosis and HCC had significantly increased serum endotoxin levels. Chronic DEN treatment of rats was associated with an imbalance of subpopulations of the gut microflora including a significant suppression of Lactobacillus species, Bifidobacterium species and Enterococcus species as well as intestinal inflammation. Induction of enteric dysbacteriosis or intestinal inflammation by penicillin or DSS, respectively, significantly promoted tumor formation. Administration of probiotics dramatically mitigated enteric dysbacteriosis, ameliorated intestinal inflammation, and most importantly, decreased liver tumor growth and multiplicity. Interestingly, probiotics not only inhibited the translocation of endotoxin, which bears pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) but also the activation of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) such as high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1). As a result, the production of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines was skewed in favor of a reduced tumorigenic inflammation in the liver. The data highlights the importance of gut homeostasis in the pathogenesis of HCC. Modulation of the gut microbiota by probiotics may represent a new avenue for therapeutic intervention to treat or prevent HCC development."

"While non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is highly prevalent (15% to 45%) in modern societies, only 10% to 25% of cases develop hepatic fibrosis leading to cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease or hepatocellular carcinoma. Apart from pre-existing fibrosis, the strongest predictor of fibrotic progression in NAFLD is steatohepatitis or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The critical features other than steatosis are hepatocellular degeneration (ballooning, Mallory hyaline) and mixed inflammatory cell infiltration. While much is understood about the relationship of steatosis to metabolic factors (over-nutrition, insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, metabolic syndrome, hypoadiponectinemia), less is known about inflammatory recruitment, despite its importance for the perpetuation of liver injury and fibrogenesis. In this review, we present evidence that liver inflammation has prognostic significance in NAFLD. We then consider the origins and components of liver inflammation in NASH. Hepatocytes injured by toxic lipid molecules (lipotoxicity) play a central role in the recruitment of innate immunity involving Toll-like receptors (TLRs), Kupffer cells (KCs), lymphocytes and neutrophils and possibly inflammasome. The key pro-inflammatory signaling pathways in NASH are nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-ÎºB) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). The downstream effectors include adhesion molecules, chemokines, cytokines and the activation of cell death pathways leading to apoptosis. The upstream activators of NF-ÎºB and JNK are more contentious and may depend on the experimental model used. TLRs are strong contenders. It remains possible that inflammation in NASH originates outside the liver and in the gut microbiota that prime KC/TLR responses, inflamed adipose tissue and circulating inflammatory cells. We briefly review these mechanistic considerations and project their implications for the effective treatment of NASH."

"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome and the leading cause of chronic liver disease in the Western world. Twenty per cent of NAFLD individuals develop chronic hepatic inflammation (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, NASH) associated with cirrhosis, portal hypertension and hepatocellular carcinoma, yet the causes of progression from NAFLD to NASH remain obscure. Here, we show that the NLRP6 and NLRP3 inflammasomes and the effector protein IL-18 negatively regulate NAFLD/NASH progression, as well as multiple aspects of metabolic syndrome via modulation of the gut microbiota. Different mouse models reveal that inflammasome-deficiency-associated changes in the configuration of the gut microbiota are associated with exacerbated hepatic steatosis and inflammation through influx of TLR4 and TLR9 agonists into the portal circulation, leading to enhanced hepatic tumour-necrosis factor (TNF)-Î± expression that drives NASH progression. Furthermore, co-housing of inflammasome-deficient mice with wild-type mice results in exacerbation of hepatic steatosis and obesity. Thus, altered interactions between the gut microbiota and the host, produced by defective NLRP3 and NLRP6 inflammasome sensing, may govern the rate of progression of multiple metabolic syndrome-associated abnormalities, highlighting the central role of the microbiota in the pathogenesis of heretofore seemingly unrelated systemic auto-inflammatory and metabolic disorders."

Six distal duodenal biopsies were obtained and snap frozen for RNA and DNA extraction, or frozen for FISH. Peripheral venous bloods were obtained from 30 patients, including 17 chronic liver disease patients. Samples were analysed by real-time PCR, to assess total bacteria, bifidobacteria, bacteroides, enterobacteria, staphylococci, streptococci, lactobacilli, enterococci, Helicobacter pylori and moraxella, as well as TNF-Î±, IL-8 and IL-18. There was no evidence of bacterial overgrowth with respect to any of the individual bacterial groups, with the exception of enterococci, which were present in higher numbers in cirrhotic patients (PÂ =Â 0.04). There were no significant differences in any of the cytokines compared to the controls.

"The beneficial effects of Bifidobacteria on health have been widely accepted. Patients with chronic liver disease have varying degrees of intestinal microflora imbalance with a decrease of total Bifidobacterial counts. Since different properties have been attributed to different Bifidobacterium species and there is no information available for the detailed changes in the genus Bifidobacterium in patients with chronic liver disease heretofore, it is meaningful to investigate the structure of this bacterium at the species level in these patients. The aim of this study was to characterize the composition of intestinal Bifidobacterium in patients with hepatitis B virus-induced chronic liver disease. Nested-PCR-based denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE), clone library, and real-time quantitative PCR were performed on the fecal samples of 16 patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB patients), 16 patients with hepatitis B virus-related cirrhosis (HBV cirrhotics), and 15 healthy subjects (Controls). Though there was no significant difference in the diversity among the three groups (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.196), Bifidobacterium dentium seems to be specifically enhanced in patients as the PCR-DGGE profiles showed, which was further validated by clone library and real-time quantitative PCR. In contrast to the B. dentium, Bifidobacterium catenulatum/Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum were detected less frequently in the predominant profile and by quantitative PCR in HBV cirrhotics than in the controls, and the level of this species was also significantly different between these two groups (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.023). Although having no quantitative difference among the three groups, Bifidobacterium longum was less commonly detected in HBV cirrhotics than in CHB patients and Controls by quantitative PCR (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.011). Thus, the composition of intestinal Bifidobacterium was deeply altered in CHB and HBV cirrhotic patients with a shift from beneficial species to opportunistic pathogens. The results provide further insights into the dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota in patients with hepatitis B virus-induced chronic liver disease and might potentially serve as guidance for the probiotics interventions of these diseases."

"Liver cirrhosis is the pathologic end stage of chronic liver disease. Increasing evidence suggests that gut flora is implicated in the pathogenesis of liver cirrhosis complications. The aim of this study was to characterize the fecal microbial community in patients with liver cirrhosis in comparison with healthy individuals. We recruited 36 patients with liver cirrhosis and 24 healthy controls. The fecal microbial communities was analyzed by way of 454 pyrosequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA V3 region followed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Community-wide changes of fecal microbiota in liver cirrhosis were observed compared with healthy controls. The proportion of phylum Bacteroidetes was significantly reduced (P=0.008), whereas Proteobacteria and Fusobacteria were highly enriched in the cirrhosis group (P=0.001 and 0.002, respectively). Enterobacteriaceae (P=0.001), Veillonellaceae (P=0.046), and Streptococcaceae (P=0.001) were prevalent in patients with cirrhosis at the family level. A positive correlation was observed between Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) score and Streptococcaceae (R=0.386, P=0.02). Lachnospiraceae decreased significantly in patients with cirrhosis (P=0.004) and correlated negatively with CTP score (R=-0.49, P=0.002). Using partial least square discriminate analysis, we identified 149 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) as key phylotypes that responded to cirrhosis, most of which were Lachnospiraceae (65 OTUs), Streptococcaceae (23 OTUs), and Veillonellaceae (21 OTUs). Fecal microbial communities are distinct in patients with cirrhosis compared with healthy individuals.

"Exposure to aflatoxins causes liver fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma posing a significant health risk for human populations and livestock. To understand the mammalian systems responses to aflatoxin-B1 (AFB1) exposure, we analyzed the AFB1-induced metabonomic changes in multiple biological matrices (plasma, urine, and liver) of rats using (1)H NMR spectroscopy together with clinical biochemistry and histopathologic assessments. We found that AFB1 exposure caused significant elevation of glucose, amino acids, and choline metabolites (choline, phosphocholine, and glycerophosphocholine) in plasma but reduction of plasma lipids. AFB1 also induced elevation of liver lipids, amino acids (tyrosine, histidine, phenylalanine, leucine, isoleucine, and valine), choline, and nucleic acid metabolites (inosine, adenosine, and uridine) together with reduction of hepatic glycogen and glucose. AFB1 further caused decreases in urinary TCA cycle intermediates (2-oxoglutarate and citrate) and elevation of gut microbiota cometabolites (phenylacetylglycine and hippurate). These indicated that AFB1 exposure caused hepatic steatosis accompanied with widespread metabolic changes including lipid and cell membrane metabolisms, protein biosynthesis, glycolysis, TCA cycle, and gut microbiota functions. This implied that AFB1 exposure probably caused oxidative-stress-mediated impairments of mitochondria functions. These findings provide an overview of biochemical consequences of AFB1 exposure and comprehensive insights into the metabolic aspects of AFB1-induced hepatotoxicity in rats."

"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) frequently results from synergism between chemical and infectious liver carcinogens. Worldwide, the highest incidence of HCC is in regions endemic for the foodborne contaminant aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Recently, gut microbes have been implicated in multisystemic diseases including obesity and diabetes. Here, the hypothesis that specific intestinal bacteria promote liver cancer was tested in chemical and viral transgenic mouse models. Helicobacter-free C3H/HeN mice were inoculated with AFB1 and/or Helicobacter hepaticus. The incidence, multiplicity and surface area of liver tumours were quantitated at 40 weeks. Molecular pathways involved in tumourigenesis were analysed by microarray, quantitative real-time PCR, liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry, ELISA, western blot and immunohistochemistry. In a separate experiment, C57BL/6 FL-N/35 mice harbouring a full-length hepatitis C virus (HCV) transgene were crossed with C3H/HeN mice and cancer rates compared between offspring with and without H hepaticus. Intestinal colonisation by H hepaticus was sufficient to promote aflatoxin- and HCV transgene-induced HCC. Neither bacterial translocation to the liver nor induction of hepatitis was necessary. From its preferred niche in the intestinal mucus layer, H hepaticus activated nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB)-regulated networks associated with innate and T helper 1 (Th1)-type adaptive immunity both in the lower bowel and liver. Biomarkers indicative of tumour progression included hepatocyte turnover, Wnt/beta-catenin activation and oxidative injury with decreased phagocytic clearance of damaged cells. Enteric microbiota define HCC risk in mice exposed to carcinogenic chemicals or hepatitis virus transgenes. These results have implications for human liver cancer risk assessment and prevention."
